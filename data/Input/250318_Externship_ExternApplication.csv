Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.

Why do you want to be a part of this program?

I am looking forward to joining the Idaho STEM Action Center's externship program because it represents a unique opportunity to enhance my teaching methodologies with real-world STEM applications. I participated in this program in the past and I had a great experience. I was able to learn a tremendous amount from my relationship with Micron in building lessons and courses for both JH and HS science classes.  As an educator at Shoshone Bannock JH/HS, I am committed to fostering a diverse and active learning environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their educational journey. This program offers a chance for me to gain practical experience by engaging directly with STEM professionals, I can better understand industry needs and trends, which will allow me to tailor my curriculum to be more relevant and engaging. This experience will help me develop hands-on, project-based learning opportunities that resonate with students' interests and future career paths.
The externship will expose me to cutting-edge educational practices and technologies. This exposure will enable me to bring innovative teaching techniques into the classroom, making STEM subjects more accessible and exciting for students, particularly in areas where there might be a decline in interest, such as reading among younger students as a foundation for STEM literacy.

This program promises to expand my professional network, providing mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other educators and industry experts. This aspect will not only refine my teaching skills but also keep me updated with the latest educational research and practices.

The insights and experiences from this externship will empower me to design curricula that are not only aligned with state standards but also with real-world applications, thereby increasing student engagement and understanding.
I anticipate gaining new strategies for classroom management and student motivation, particularly in STEM fields, which can be challenging to teach in an engaging manner.
Working alongside professionals in STEM will boost my confidence in teaching these subjects, knowing I am preparing students with skills that are directly applicable in the workforce

My students will see the direct connection between what they learn in class and real-world scenarios, which can motivate them to pursue STEM fields more seriously. By bringing fresh, industry-informed perspectives into the classroom, I can help rekindle interest in STEM, especially among students who might feel disconnected from traditional teaching methods. The externship will allow me to introduce career exploration into my teaching, helping students to envision their future in STEM careers, thereby providing them with a clearer path and motivation for their educational journey.


This externship will not only enrich my teaching practices but also significantly enhance the educational experience and career readiness of the students I serve.

In this role, I managed a team of coaches, organized events, and led initiatives to increase community engagement. This experience has honed my ability to motivate diverse groups and manage complex projects under pressure, skills I believe are directly transferable to leading educational projects outside the traditional classroom setting.
I've also worked in project management for a small educational consulting company, where I was responsible for overseeing the development of a new software tool from conception to launch. This role involved coordinating with cross-functional teams, managing timelines, and ensuring project deliverables met quality standards. My experience here has equipped me with the skills to manage educational projects or camp activities that require meticulous planning and execution.
Beyond my work as an educator, I've engaged in independent research projects focused on self-development and youth, which included fieldwork and data analysis. This experience not only sharpened my research skills but also my ability to translate complex information into accessible knowledge, useful for creating educational content or leading informative sessions at camps or externships.
I have directed multiple summer camps, both in educational and recreational contexts. One notable experience was running a STEM-focused camp where I developed and oversaw a curriculum that integrated outdoor activities with science education. This role involved managing logistics, staff training, and program development, ensuring that every aspect of the camp was both educational and engaging.

I have dedicated 26 years to the field of education, emphasizing that the most valuable lessons I impart to my students extend beyond traditional content. I focus on essential skills such as resilience, persistence, problem-solving, creative and critical thinking, and collaboration. Collaborating with professionals from various fields outside of education has enriched my perspective on the skills students will require and the opportunities that lie ahead of them.
In 2024, I participated in the externship program, which enabled me to bring a wealth of experience back to my classroom. This experience allowed me to design learning tasks aimed at intentionally developing my students' soft skills, ensuring they recognize the importance of these behaviors and dispositions in all areas of life, including school, career, and personal growth.
Throughout my journey, I have shared my experiences of stepping outside my comfort zone to acquire new skills and apply them in innovative ways—opportunities I had not envisioned before the externship. Additionally, I have introduced my art students to STEM career options that they may have previously overlooked, such as graphic and web design, thereby broadening their horizons.
I aspire to continue my professional development through the 2025 Externship program, with the goal of providing my students with even more valuable and meaningful guidance as they prepare for their futures.

I am a very good cook/baker. I enjoy knitting and reading during the cooler months. I have no problem speaking with others and enjoy learning about people, their life experiences enthrall me.
I am a farmer with no land. I believe wholeheartedly about eating real foods. A bucket list goal is to grow fresh vegetables and fruits to those who can't afford them, regardless of where they live. Basically establishing a fresh food pantry on wheels is a life long dream of mine.
I love everything to do with hunting and fishing! I have spent the last 10 years hunting the mountains of Idaho. I am an archery hunter and have such wonderful memories with my husband and son. Hiking to remote areas and seeing land and animals/fish that not many people get to see without some effort is incredible to me. Using a drone to capture views in mountainous terrain is so much fun! Spending the night in the open and hearing bugle calls or the cry of a wolf is indescribable. I will never forget my fishing trip to Riggins with my husband, our first attempt at salmon fishing was hilarious!
I am a positive asset to most teams. I come prepared and willing to learn. I put my best effort into anything that I do as long as I am respected and given the opportunity to do so.

I can take students into our local communities to research, see, and experience what we learn in the classroom.  Students also have the opportunity to go into the community and teach others what they have learned.  As a teacher, this model is transformative, and learning new skills in other settings outside of education is very important to me.  It allows me to build a network to provide our students with new opportunities. 

I am currently a 4th-grade teacher.  We study life science and focus on Idaho Sage Brush Ecosystems.  I also study the Oregon trail and Idhao history.  We have extensive discussions on technology, how much the world has changed in a few 100 years, and how our environment has changed because of technology.  I would be so excited to intern at a place where I can make connections to Idaho history and agriculture. It is so important to help students connect our past to our present and future.  It helps them better understand what and why and guides them to new areas to explore. My current class is interested in geothermal technology, communication, transportation, conservation of rivers and land, power and dams, farming, economics (supply and demand), medicine, transportation, and archeology.  

I am in my 7th year of teaching. I have taught 5th, 2nd, and 4th grade.  I am currently a 4th-grade teacher.  I live rurally in Prama and commute 30 miles to school each way.  I have horses and a garden, and I am interested in Ag!  I have spent time around a dairy farm, horse farms, and trucking.  
I enjoy developing curriculum, professional development, and data analysis at school. I led the school-wide behavior team.  As a part of that team, I built a staff website with resources, lessons, videos, and our data-tracking spreadsheet.  I have some experience with video creation and editing.  I also have experience in event planning, online learning platforms, and training staff.  

I completed my first master's in 2018.  I completed a research study on classroom management.  Last May, I completed my second master's in Educational Leadership at BSU.

I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where ""research projects"" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, ""this is English; why are we talking about science?"" or accused of defending math as ""the magical, universal language."" I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field ""trips"" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic ""fasces"", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

For example, I teach in a low income school, and my 4th grade class this year has completed several LEGO STEM projects (the LEGO sets were provided by the Idaho Department of Education); during one of these projects, a boy said to me, ""I always knew about LEGOS, but I never got to play with any before. They're great!""

Public schools are also ideal for STEM outreach because these activities are so engaging for such a broad spectrum of students; for instance, a girl in my class  who is typically very shy but highly intelligent, comes alive during our LEGO and Mystery Science curriculum, she steps up and happily engages with her peers, often leading her group in a way that is both sensitive and innovative. However, it isn't just intellectual but shy students who engage with STEM activities in my classroom, my academically struggling students also come alive with STEM activities, suddenly happy to give answers and engage in building and drawing projects. 

STEM instruction in classrooms can help meet the needs of all learners, can create cross-curricular activities, can add rigor for students who are excelling, but can also excite and support struggling students, so I am always looking for ways to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world applications. Gaining hands-on experience in how STEM is applied in the workplace would provide invaluable insight that I can bring back to my students. Also, by understanding the practical applications of STEM concepts, I can better design lessons that connect to career pathways, inspire curiosity, and demonstrate the relevance of these skills in solving real-world challenges.

Additionally, meeting STEM professionals from diverse backgrounds will allow me to share stories of their journeys with my students, helping them see the wide range of possibilities in STEM fields. Learning what employers value when hiring STEM employees will also guide me in preparing my students with the skills, mindsets, and experiences they need to be competitive in the workforce.

This interdisciplinary approach not only strengthens students’ ability to articulate complex ideas but also prepares them to excel in a workforce that demands collaboration and effective communication across diverse fields.

Bridging STEM and ELA is particularly crucial in fostering inclusivity and engagement. Students who may feel intimidated by the technical nature of STEM subjects can find a voice through ELA skills such as narrative writing or presenting findings in a compelling way.

As an educator, I am always striving to offer my students a dynamic and interdisciplinary learning experience that reflects the real-world connections between subjects. By participating in this program, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of STEM concepts and how they can be seamlessly woven into ELA lessons. 

I believe that integrating STEM into my ELA classroom will help foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration among students—skills that are essential for success in the 21st century. For example, I could incorporate STEM-focused texts, like engineering case studies or science fiction, into literature discussions or have students engage in project-based learning that ties in both language arts and STEM topics. This would encourage creativity, improve analytical skills, and make learning more relevant to students’ lives.

Additionally, I hope that through this internship, I can gain the tools and knowledge to better engage students who may not traditionally see the connection between language arts and STEM fields. By integrating these subjects, I can demonstrate to my students that writing, reading, and communication are essential skills in all areas of learning and in nearly every career, including those in the sciences and technology.

Ultimately, I aim to empower my students to be more confident and curious learners who approach problems from multiple perspectives. I am confident that this internship will not only enrich my own teaching practice but also inspire my students to pursue STEM opportunities with creativity and enthusiasm.",,Yes,,,No specific preference - anything goes!;,In-Person;Remote;Hybrid;,,3;4;5;6;7;8;,No specific STEM domain experience;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2083122562,,Monday to Friday after 3:45 Friday anytime,Strongly agree ,83350,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,100 hours ;200 hours ;,Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Presentation Software (MS Powerpoint or Google Slides);,No

During my tenure, I have observed a gap between what students learn in school and how they can apply that knowledge to real life. Often, students memorize concepts without understanding their relevance, learning just to pass tests rather than seeing the meaningful connections to their lives.

I believe that participating in The Idaho Educator Externship Program will help me bridge this gap. By gaining a deeper understanding of how different science and math concepts are used in various industries, I can bring real-world applications into my classroom. This will not only enhance my teaching but also make learning more engaging and relevant for my students.

Additionally, I hope to build long-term relationships with my host and potentially establish partnerships that allow students to see firsthand how the knowledge they acquire in school is applied in future careers. This exposure will inspire them and provide a clearer vision of how their education can impact their lives and the world around them.

Ultimately, this program will benefit both my professional growth and my students' learning experiences, fostering a deeper connection between classroom concepts and real-world applications.
