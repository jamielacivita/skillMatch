INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
With advances in technology and AI, I recognize a need to personally change and improve the way in which my students learn and use different technologies so that they are more marketable as they leave high school and prepare for college and future careers. This requires me being more willing to change the way I teach. One of those routes would be to improve my own networking and being more aware of possibilities around me in the communities surrounding me. Its also important for my middle school students to see the possibilities and applications of those things they learn and how and in what manner they may need to use the information in the future.
