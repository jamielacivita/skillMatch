INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an art teacher, I know a large percentage of my students will eventually work in fields other than the fine arts.  I teach my students that the creative process, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills they develop through creating art will serve them well in any career, especially STEM careers.  I believe when STEM grows to STEAM, the artistry and creativity that accompanies engineering and design make for more powerful solutions and inventions.  I would like to learn more about these fields my students may eventually be working in so the message and information I share in class can be more accurate and applicable.
