INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:

I personally would like to increase my technology experience as I bring new hands-on projects to my social studies students.  I also aim to increase my experience with instructional design, business operations, and industry in general as I am currently studying this.  Furthermore, I appreciated and enjoyed making new connections and would like to continue doing so this year.
