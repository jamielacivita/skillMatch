INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
My name is Jill Chaffin and I teach middle school science in Twin Falls, Idaho. I work at a Title 1 school who's population lives below the poverty line. I want to provide as many opportunities for these students to see jobs other than fast food or manual labor. Most of these students will live in this area for the rest of their life. I want to connect them with local opportunities that will allow them to rise above their current living conditions. But I also want these students to connect with the world around them. STEM is the perfect field to educate and empower kids to reach beyond their current knowledge. It's fun, interactive, and fulfilling.
