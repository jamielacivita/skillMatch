INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
Currently, I teach a unit on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.  Part of that unit includes forests-from birth to fire to regrowth.  Having hands-on knowledge of this process and insight into our local forest service careers would fit exceptionally well with our standards. Teaching students about our local careers may give them opportunities to give back to our community. I'd love to learn more about how the process works in our area so I can teach our local children something that is so vital to Idaho.  Forest fires are interesting to students and a topic that can expand their education.  For me, personally, I've lived in these mountains for about 19 years and learning more about them sounds like an exciting opportunity.
