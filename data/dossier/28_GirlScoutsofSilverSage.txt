ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
Girl Scouts is the premier female K-12 leadership program in the United States. Our mission is to build girls of courage, confidence and character who make the word a better place. STEM is one of our four pillars of Girl Scouts. We encourage girls to ask questions about their world around them, brainstorm solutions to problems they face and make a change in their community through service projects and community engagement. There are over 150 badges girls can earn in STEM, including STEM Career Exploration. We also explore topics in life sciences, the outdoors, robotics and engineering and more!

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Increasing STEM program variety and accessibility for girls in Idaho

Objectives
	* Girl Scouts of Silver Sage Council (GSSSC) will have updated and accesible programming that can be implemented in multiple delivery methods (virtual and in person) and scales (small groups to large events of 200+ attendees) to girls and their communities across Idaho.		


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The intern will work with the Program Manager to update innovative, creative and sustainable STEM programming for our membership. Day to day tasks include curriculum research, analyzing regional demographics, and creating programs and lessons that can be used by troop leaders, volunteers and council staff for groups of varying sizes (5 - 200+). Grant writing will also be part of this effort.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Our STEM curriculum is next generation science standards aligned. It can be implemented into classrooms and afterschool programs. Much of our curriculum already provides ties to careers and skills needed for STEM professionals.


Network growth:
	* The extern will interact with our council staff from various departments and will reach out to STEM community partners as they develop their program activities. We already have a good relationship with many STEM partners and we will make introductions between the interns and the partners. This will give the extern an avenue for bringing in partners for their classrooms

Skills desired:
	*No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;
