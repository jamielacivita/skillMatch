ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Implementing drone curriculum into formal and informal STEM learning and teaching in K-12 education settings		

Objectives
	* The extern will learn drone technologies from scratch to be implementable in their formal classrooms

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The extern will dedicate time to visiting IDRONE headquarter in Boise to learn a step-by-step drone building, coding, and flight skills, ultimately implementing drone curriculum in their disciplines (e.g., physics, math, earth and space science)

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Drone is everywhere, it is not military-centric business anymore. The extern will learn broad view of fast-moving technologies, including drones and ground robots and will also help tech-savvy students utilize such technology safely and legally in the public domain. 

Network growth:
	* The extern will interact with IDRONE Staff, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and the previous externs to share knowledge and experience to solidify their application in formal classrooms by experiencing interdisciplinary and collaborative learning in the rapidly evolving field of drone technology.

Skills desired:
	*Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Presentation Software (MS Powerpoint or Google Slides);Secondary-Level Instructional Experience;Elementary-Level Instructional experience;Curriculum Design;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* Life Science / Biology;Physics;Earth & Environmental Science;Math;Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.);Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.);Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources;Engineering & Technology;Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.);
