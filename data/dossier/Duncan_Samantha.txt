INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I participated in the program last summer. I found that I liked the program, but do not think I had the right match. I want to want to continue to spread STEM education in my community working with multiple age groups. I have been speaking directly with the Lincoln County Youth Center in Richfield, ID about running summer STEM camps for K-12 students in the county.
