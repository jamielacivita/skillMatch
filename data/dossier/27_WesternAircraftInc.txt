ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Western Aircraft A&P Apprentice Program

Objectives
	* The desired business outcome is to strengthen our apprentice program by having educators train our trainers and apprentice group.  We want the extern to learn real world aviation and take that experience back to the classroom.   Overall benefit will support the current shortage of A&P mechanics. 

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Classroom and hands on training with fully operational aircraft.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* The instructor will participate in fully operational aviation repair station tasks in real world outside of a training environment and take that back to the classroom for instruction.  This will better prepare their students for what to expect when they leave the training environment.

Network growth:
	* They will have access to the entire Aviation Maintenance group and will work side by side with our dedicated trainer and apprentices in our program every day.

Skills desired:
	*Current Airframe & Powerplant instructor experience ;
