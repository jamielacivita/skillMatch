Location: Moscow and Boise, ID
Remote Possible: Yes

ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
The College of Engineering at the University of Idaho educates future engineers and computer scientists in the technical and professional skills necessary to meeting, and exceeding, industry standards, and preparing students for the Idaho (and global) STEM workforce. 

In the College of Engineering Micron Student Center, we run K12 STEM Outreach to engage and inspire the next generation of engineers and computer scientists. Led by the Assistant Director of K12 Outreach and Student Engagement, and implemented by a team of 18 college student ambassadors, our team partners with Idaho educators to bring STEM activities to K12 classrooms. Ambassadors give presentations to teach kids about engineering and computer science, and run hands-on, interactive STEM activities that students can use to engage in STEM and learn/practice the engineering design process.  Our goal is to inspire a new generation of diverse kids who persist in and pursue engineering and computer science in college and in their careers.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* U of I College of Engineering K12 STEM Outreach Extern

Objectives
	* The extern position will support the Assistant Director of K12 STEM Outreach and Student Engagement in developing K12 STEM outreach activities, mapping activities to engineering majors and current lab research and implementing a coding camp to middle schoolers. Travel will be required.

Key responsibilities include planning, coordinating and executing events and STEM activities, gathering information for quality STEM curriculum, conducting informational interviews, and proposing innovative ideas for STEM outreach activity implementation.


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* In this role, the extern will:
-	modify current and develop new and innovative K12 STEM outreach activities, instruction worksheets and learning outcomes/evaluation that college student ambassadors will implement in the academic year,
-	interview College of Engineering faculty and graduate students to learn more about their current research,
-	map the K12 STEM activities to current research and lab activity, and to the engineering and computer science majors offered in the College of Engineering,
-	develop an organized system for STEM activity supplies,
-	assist the implementation of a three-week coding camp for middle school kids in Moscow, Boise, and Twin Falls (travel required and covered),
-	engage in outreach activities in coordination with the Nez Perce Tribe,
-	tour industry facilities of industry partners (i.e. Micron, Chobani, Clearwater Paper, SEL) to learn more about real-world STEM careers, 
-	review and update Idaho K12 educator contact database.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* The extern will meet with engineering faculty and graduate students to learn about the various majors in engineering and computer science, as well as the research and projects being developed. They will gain insight and familiarity with our five engineering and computer science departments: civil engineering, computer science and cybersecurity, mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and chemical and biological engineering. The extern will use this knowledge to develop and modify STEM activities mapped to current research, lab projects, and engineering/computer science majors, as well as Idaho STEM education standards. These activities can be brought back to the classroom, and the extern can develop an action plan to partner with our K12 STEM outreach team to visit their classroom for college ambassadors to teach and engage/inspire their class of students.

Further, through informational interviews with engineering/computer science faculty, and industry tours, the extern will make connections for future field trips and examples of what real-world engineers are working on for a better future.


Network growth:
	* Through informational interviews of faculty and graduate students from five engineering and computer science departments, the extern will meet real-world STEM professionals and learn about their jobs and projects. Through industry tours, the extern will meet real-world STEM professionals, network, and make connections for prospective K12 activities and field trips. Industry tours may include Micron, Chobani, Clearwater Paper and/or Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. 

Skills desired:
	* Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Presentation Software (MS Powerpoint or Google Slides);Secondary-Level Instructional Experience;Elementary-Level Instructional experience;Curriculum Design;Email & Administrative Software;K12 experience in STEM - can be secondary or elementary;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;Chemistry;Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.);Engineering & Technology;STEM education - in general - STEM activities are mostly related to the fields of engineering and computer science - so any of the below can relate. We've marked "True" for areas most related to our projects.;Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.);
