ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
Gizmo is North Idaho's premier non-profit makerspace offering 12,000 square feet of creative tools, materials, machinery and fabrication technology. Our mission is to build creative confidence and curiosity by providing all people access to tools, technology and mentors.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Makerspace Documentation Development		

Objectives
	* Learn operation and maintenance processes for various tools in the makerspace and develop internal & public-facing documentation for those tools

Description and day-to-day tasks:

- Draft user guides, maintenance manuals, daily/weeky maintenance charts & tool certification checklists for designated tools
- Create shop signage that aligns with user guides and makerspace policy"

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This project will expose the educator to tools, processes and technical terminology associated with STEM jobs, particularly as related to advanced manufacturing. Exposure to the inner workings of machinery -- how software interacts with hardware, how CNC machines are typically built and how to troubleshoot problems effectively -- will also give educators more confidence for delving into higher level projects and/or incorporating more advanced technologies with their students.	

Network growth:
	* Working in a makerspace, the extern will interact with a variety of professionals, tinkerers and hobbyists who represent the broad spectrum of real world engagement with STEM. 	

Skills desired:
	*Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Project Management;Email & Administrative Software;Willing to get their hands dirty!;
