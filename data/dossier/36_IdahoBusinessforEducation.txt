IBE collaborates with the Governor, Legislature, State Board of Education, State Department of Education, and other stakeholders to pass policies and investments that support students and educators and give them opportunities for success.Our schoolhouse strategy helps kids all over Idaho. We work closely with local school leaders and trustees to ensure that students are prepared academically to achieve a postsecondary credential.
