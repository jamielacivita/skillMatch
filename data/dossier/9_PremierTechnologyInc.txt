ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Quality Assurance Externship		

Objectives
	* The desired outcome will be Premier Technology, Inc.'s NQA-1 Training manuals to be organized and compiled to meet the required SOP's and Welding Apprentice, Craft I & II Welders to be instructed in Geometry, Algebra, and Calculus.		


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Extern will spend the majority of the day organizing and compiling Premier Technology's NQA-1 training manuals by department, job, and add any necessary updates. Then on scheduled days, teach the Welding Apprentices and Craft I/II Welders the basics of Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus to match the "real word" environment of a manufacturing shop.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This project will show externs that STEM subjects are used every day in Premier Technology's industry. The extern will learn how to effectively breakdown a story problem in a manufacturing/engineering environment, gather vital information, discard unrelated details, and come up with a solution that qualifies with standard operating procedures. This will create a perfect opportunity for the extern to show their students a "real world" scenario of where STEM subjects are vital for the majority of trade and professional careers.	


Network growth:
	* The extern will work with and shadow: engineers, fabricators, project managers, inspectors, etc. to demonstrate how departments function together.	


Skills desired:
	*Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Presentation Software (MS Powerpoint or Google Slides);Secondary-Level Instructional Experience;Curriculum Design;Project Management;Public Speaking / Group Presentation;
