ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
Our organization helps resettle newly arrived refugees in Boise. The Youth Services team specifically supports the integration of youth into their schools and community. We do this by helping families enroll in schools, create an integration plan, and access extracurricular programming. Part of our programming is STEM focused, with after-school and summer programming focused on STEM.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* IRC Youth Services Summer Programming

Objectives
	* The desired outcomes of our program are social emotional asset development, academic progress, and relationship building with the students we work with. These come through a variety of programs we offer.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Over the summer time, the IRC Youth Services Program day-to-day involves running youth programming, referring families to external youth programs, facilitating school enrollments, monitoring program progress, transporting youth, and communicating with families.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Working with the IRC's Youth Services Team over the summer will provide STEM externs the chance to work directly with students in summer learning environments that often include STEM programming. Additionally, our youth participants are newly Americans who've been previously displaced from their home country, so externs will get the opportunity to work with a diverse range of students from many countries and linguistic backgrounds. There will also be ample opportunities for externs to engage with the data capture side of our work.

Network growth:
	* Primarily they will work with our program partners who support our summer programming, such as the Idaho Botanical Gardens, the Boise Public Library system, the Boise School District, the Boise Bicycle Project, and the City of Boise.

Skills desired:
	*Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Project Management;Email & Administrative Software;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* All of the above can be helpful. Rather than looking for one specific STEM domain, we are looking for someone with experience running extracurricular activities and who is comfortable with or excited to work with data.;
