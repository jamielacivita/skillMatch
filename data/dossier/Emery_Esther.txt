INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I am a naturally curious person who thrives on new experiences and challenging tasks. I am personally very excited by the idea of having access to a workplace for which my educational background alone wouldn't necessarily qualify me. I currently teach grade 2, but it is unlikely that I will stay in one grade level for my entire career. What I really want is to absorb the reality of STEM careers so that my worldview reflects that in all my conversations with young people. The degree to which I value STEM directly affects the level of motivation we have to accomplish STEM activities, and the amount of time I spend on them.

Other interesting experience:
I became a full-time educator at age 40. My college degree is in theater arts. I have substantial experience in theater technology and performance, dance performance, and theater management. I am also a published author and have had a successful YouTube channel. Since none of the roles listed above are especially lucrative, I have also paid the bills with a number of entry-level positions in various fields, including private tutoring, being a nursing assistant, at one point cleaning glassware in a biochem lab, and working desks in a few different administrative roles.
