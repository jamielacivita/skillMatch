INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I participated in this program last year and I had an amazing experience with it. It allowed me to bring skills back to the classroom for both my students and myself. I think being able to step out of the classroom and get experience in other fields allows teachers to get a plethora of skills they may not otherwise receive. When a teacher has new skills to bring into the classroom, it also benefits the students as well!
