Email: rhansen@micron.com
Location: Boise, Idaho
Remote Possible: No

ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
Micron Technology is a world leader in innovating memory and storage solutions that accelerate the transformation of information into intelligence, inspiring the world to learn, communicate and advance faster than ever.   
F4 Manufacturing Technicians contribute to cycle time reduction by facilitating product movement, keeping lot mean time at step (MTAS) low and including advanced support tasks. The area MT is the first responder on area inefficiencies, i.e. lots not tracking/staging, data not down loading, tool lockups, and lot processed verification. The MT applies production planning reports to review historical workstation performance and identify areas for improvement. 

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Job Shadow

Objectives
	* Externs will send time shadowing a very wide range of team members, departments, managers and senior leaders.  Externs will spend time at Micron both inside and outside the cleanroom fab facility. 

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* STEM is a core part of the Manufacturing Technician and Manufacturing Engineer roles at Micron.  Externs will better understand how STEM relates to the specific job roles in our department.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* We have a strong Extern Rotation schedule planned out for our Externs who come to Micron.  We provide detailed training schedule and allow for adjustments based on Extern feedback during their time at Micron.   STEM is a core part of the Manufacturing Technician and Manufacturing Engineer roles at Micron.  Externs will better understand how STEM relates to the specific job roles in our department. 

Network growth:
	* Externs at Micron are given the opportunity to job shadow multiple job roles and learn first hand how STEM relates to real-world work. 

Skills desired:
	* Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Presentation Software (MS Powerpoint or Google Slides);Secondary-Level Instructional Experience;Project Management;Public Speaking / Group Presentation;Email & Administrative Software;Adult Education / Training;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* Life Science / Biology;Chemistry;Physics;Math;Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.);Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.);Engineering & Technology;Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.);
