Why they want to be a part of this program:
I teach outdoor survival.  We do many fun things outside from compasses and GPS to knot tying to making traps.  It is a hands on class that students love.  I am interested in having an externship with an outdoors related business.  Many of my students hunt, fish, ski, camp, etc.  I want to know what career opportunities are available in the outdoor arena.  I develop my own curriculum and am always looking for more real life ideas to bring into the classroom.
