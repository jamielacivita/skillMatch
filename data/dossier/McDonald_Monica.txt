INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I teach both 8th grade Science and the AVID Elective, which focuses on early college and career readiness. I hope to gain work experiences that I can not only bring back to my classroom, but also share with my former students, so that they can successfully pursue meaningful careers. 8th grade is an essential time to expose students to this information because they are beginning to plan their high school classes and prepare for future careers. 

My Externship this past summer allowed me to teach my current students about 21st century skills and essential work habits through real world examples.  In addition, I was able to share career opportunities with current and former students, including providing details of the Idaho Works and Idaho Launch programs, as well as utilizing resources from Idaho Connect. It also inspired me to create a new agenda with time-blocking that taught my students better time management. The Externship was an invaluable opportunity and I hope to build on the experiences I gained last summer to teach my future students about more career opportunities and skills.

Other interesting experience:
Prior to becoming a teacher, I worked in sales for over 6 years, managing $1 million+ territories and served as a claims auditor for 3 years, so I am very detail oriented, with a results focused mindset. I also have strong communication skills, both oral and written, and feel very comfortable presenting to groups.  

I am very proficient in Microsoft applications and have earned Microsoft Innovative Educator Badges for training in 21st century skills. I also have experience with Canva, a visual graphics program, and enjoy learning new programs and applications.

I have volunteered in organizations that promote community service and kindness including Builder's Club (part of Kiwanis), Sources of Strength and Ben's Bells.  In the past, I have also volunteered for organizations as a teen youth advisor, including serving as an overnight counselor at a runaway shelter.
