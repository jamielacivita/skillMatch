INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
This is my first year being a full time teacher in a brick and mortar school building. [I taught part-time, online school for a couple of years before this.] I am constantly seeking out new opportunities that will allow me to continue to grow as an educator and expand the tools in my arsenal that I can use in order to help reach all of my students in my classroom regardless of how they learn on an individual basis. I know that upon first glance some people might not think that a music educator has much need for experience in a STEM program such as this, but I firmly believe that every educator can learn and apply tools from all walks of life in their individual classrooms if they have the drive and determination to do so. I never want the limitations I put on myself to be the reason that a student is not as successful in one of my classes as they could have been if I simply would have taken the time to learn and grow outside of my typical comfort zone.
