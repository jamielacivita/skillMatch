INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I have been fortunate enough to work as an Externship employee in the healthcare field. I learned so much while working in healthcare. My hope to benefit for myself is to gain  knowledge of the vast array of jobs/careers one can embark on. The crazy thing is some of the things we are preparing students for have not even been an option because it hasn't happened yet. How cool is that? My hope is to gain information from working outside the four walls of a school and and truly focus on individuals and their potential.
