INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I got to participate last year and it was a very meaningful experience. Particularly (something I didn't know at the time I applied) in my career explorations class I now teach after the state legislature passed their bill requiring a career explorations course for all middle school students before they leave 8th grade. This has helped with my perspective in that course and talking with students about my experiences outside of teaching.
This applicant likes work environments that are:
	* Collaborative work
	* Task-oriented work
	* Expect workers to be self-driven
	* Strong appetite for networking & outreach needed
	* Comfort with ambiguity needed

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.)
