INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I was a part of the extern program last year and had a wonderful experience. I worked with Micron and it felt like a whole other world compared to teaching. It made me appreciate what other jobs are out there in case I ever want to explore another career. However, I'd like to learn more about other careers that I can introduce my math students to - not all of them were invested in the world of nanotechnology that I shared with them earlier this year.
This applicant likes work environments that are:
	* Creative work
	* Task-oriented work
	* Directive in nature
	* Comfort with ambiguity needed
	* Collaborative work

Other interesting experience:
I really enjoyed my job as a science educator at the Discovery Center of Idaho. I created and ran camps on various topics (chemistry, astronomy, coding, robotics, paleontology) with ages 6-15. Last year as an extern at Micron, I enjoyed several aspects of it - mostly learning the process of microchips and all of the various jobs that are required to make one. I love learning and I love meeting people!
