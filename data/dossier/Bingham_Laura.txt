INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have had the unique opportunity to work with Idaho Science and Aerospace Scholars academy that is a partnership with the Idaho Education Department and NASA. Through this program I have met professionals that are involved in space exploration and as a biology major, my mind was expanded in ways I could never imagined. I learned the value of stepping out of the classroom and meeting science-minded people out in the world making a difference in their own way. I have been able to set the sights of my students higher as I make careers seem more accessible because I know people who do those jobs. As they said at the She-Tech conference, "If you can't see it, you can't be it." I want to help students see it.

Other interesting experience:
I have worked with Idaho Science and Aerospace Scholars Academy for three years. This collaboration between Boise State University, the Department of Education and NASA takes a group of students for a week and hosts them locally and flies everyone to California to visit a NASA center such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I worked as a mentor, which meant that I was in charge of a group of 10-12 students. We worked together, ate together, and created bonds through our time. 
In my school I am the advisor for the Girls in STEM club that promotes science, technology, engineering, and math experiences. We have toured a local medical school, gone to local science conferences for students and talk to professionals in STEM careers.
