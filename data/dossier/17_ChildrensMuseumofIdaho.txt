ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name: Children's Museum of Idaho STEM Programming and Enrichment
Objectives:
It has been mutually beneficial for the Children's Museum to host summer externs.  The museum is able to expand programming with the additional staff and the extern learns first-hand how to interact with young children to expand and enhance STEM learning experiences.
Description and day-to-day tasks:
STEM camps, planetarium shows, Museum on the Move outreach, other STEM activities as needed.
Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
Many of the activities facilitated by the Program staff are unique to the museum.  We have both onsite and portable planetariums that provide exceptional learning opportunities for young children.  By exploring Earth and Space, children are exposed to a vast number of STEM related fields of study.  
Network growth:
The Program Director will meet with, and mentor, the extern during the externship.  A new "Girls in STEM" program will be developed to be initiated in September.  The extern may assist with developing this program.
