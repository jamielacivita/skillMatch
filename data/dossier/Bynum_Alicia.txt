INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I participated in the Externship last year with the INL stem project. I learned about various opportunities available for high school students through the INL. I have been able to take this information back to my students in the classroom. I also was able to bring new hands on opportunities for my students through the study of stem. The students love using hands on practices along with the traditional learning in the classroom.
