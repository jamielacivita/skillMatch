Other interesting experience:
I have experience in welding and construction from my jobs before education. I have a few hobbies that I love. I enjoy the outdoors where I hunt and fish or just explore. I have had a green thumb for most of my life. In the past couple years I have been growing giant pumpkins. I am trying to break the Idaho record of 1400 lbs. Last season my largest pumpkin was 1207 lbs. I hope to grow them even bigger this coming year. I have been 3D printing for a few years and teach my students about 3D design and then printing their creations. I love to learn and tend to be project based. I try and have a couple of summer projects to keep me out of trouble.
