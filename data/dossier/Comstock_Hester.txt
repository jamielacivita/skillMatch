INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I was an extern at Ada Animal Hospital in the summer of 2023.  The way teachers think is NOT the way business leaders often think and the merging of these ways of thinking really can be good for both.  I learned a lot and I feel like I contributed a lot, too.  I'm interested in trying this again!

I completed a STEM externship last summer at a veterinary clinic.... learned a lot, but was not great as a receptionist.
