INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator, I am excited about the opportunity to participate in CHIP Camp this summer. This program will allow me to further develop my skills in STEM education and hands-on learning. Through workshops and collaborating with other teachers, I will gain new ideas, methods, and confidence for teaching engineering and technology concepts in engaging ways.

My participation in CHIP Camp will directly translate to benefits for the students I work with. I will be able to bring back a variety of activities and lesson plans that promote problem-solving, teamwork, and design thinking. With the training I receive at camp, I will be better equipped to teach STEM principles in an interactive manner that resonates with today's learners. Students will have the chance to take part in building, programming, and innovating - opportunities that get them actively involved in learning.

I hope my experience at CHIP Camp allows me to inspire more students, particularly girls and underrepresented minorities, to pursue interests and careers in STEM fields. With the knowledge I gain, I can nurture students' curiosity, build their technical abilities, and pave the way for their future success and contribution to society. Participating in CHIP Camp is an invaluable professional development opportunity that will make me a better STEM educator and positively impact the youth I work with in meaningful ways.
