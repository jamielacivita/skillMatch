INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I had a great experience last year with the Idaho STEM Externship program. Through the program, I was able to connect with local professionals and University of Idaho professors. I was connected to the Idaho Drone League (IDrone) through the University of Idaho. It was completely new for me and helped me bring more STEM opportunities to my 6th grade students this year. I would like to continue working as an IDrone extern this summer to learn more about STEM education and opportunities. Also, I would like to work with IDrone on creating curriculum to extend what students learn in IDrone to their communities in Idaho. My goal is for the externship is to fully implement the IDrone curriculum with my 6th graders in Sandpoint, Idaho which would extend STEM opportunities to students in rural Idaho.
