INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I was a part of the program last year at St. Luke's.  The experience was eye-opening, as I have always and always worked in education and never for a private business.  St. Luke's was able to build a schedule that suited my needs.  Since I knew so little about tech in the healthcare industry, I was able to take tours of departments and become educated by some of the most talented and gifted people I have ever met.  Their style and techniques were inspirations to me as a fellow educator.  The skills people use to do their daily jobs are transferrable skills to learning situations in a public school classroom.  I would love to hone in on some of the work we started last year.  There are new experiences that I need to take my tech and business etiquette teachings to the next level.
