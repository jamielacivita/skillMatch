INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* This is such an exciting program to be involved in as it not only empowers the participants, but also empowers the EXTERN. The valuable skills that are obtained are endless. I appreciate how much this encompasses and prepares participants for the current labor force as well as students for learning. I live and teach in a rural school district area and find this helpful in obtaining skills to use as I further my educational career here. I attended a workshop last Spring and found this an exciting opportunity and loved the ideas I obtained to use in the classroom. The more we can get this out to students the more valuable it becomes. I am happy to assist in anyway as I worked in the insurance business world for 31 years, taught elementary for 6 years, and this year a principal. I love to Learn!
