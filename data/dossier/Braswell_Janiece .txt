INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I feel like seeing real live STEM in action in the workplace will give me valuable insight into what kids need to be learning and doing in school so that they can become productive citizens in the ever changing world.  My hope is that I will gain valuable ideas for project based, hands on learning that I can implement into my classroom and share with my whole school community.   Students at the early elementary grades really love having manipulatives and things they can use to learn with, build and play.  Often times, I feel like their imagination gets squashed, as they spend more and more time on screens.  I know I can do a better job of fostering these creative types of learning experiences by seeing examples and being part of something bigger in my community.  I feel like being a part of this externship program will give me field experience to fully understand more about STEM and how to successfully integrate that better into my teaching repertoire.  I also hope that my students will gain a sense of collaboration and teamwork.  The past few years I have really noticed students are lacking communication skills and don’t know how to get along well with others.  If I can bring more project based learning into the classroom I feel like everyone will benefit.

I volunteer my time in many positions with my teacher’s union (bargaining, member recruitment, phone banking).  I love art, reading, the outdoors, and all things creative.
