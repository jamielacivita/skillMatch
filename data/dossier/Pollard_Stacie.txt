INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
With Glenns Ferry being such a small, rural town, many of our students do not get to experience as much as our neighboring schools in Ada County or Twin Falls County do.  As an educator, I want to utilize the resources we have locally to provide opportunities for the children in our community to grow and thrive in a world outside of what they know.  I want to give them experiences that will encourage them to think bigger, including how they can turn what they love doing into a career.
