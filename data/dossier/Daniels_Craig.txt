INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I would like to participate in an externship in computer science. I would like insight into the industry so I can adjust my courses to better prepare my students for careers in computer science. I would also like to do an externship to help me work towards getting a Career Technical Education certificate in Computer Science so I can expand the computer science courses I can teach for my school. Expanding course offerings at my high school will allow my students to get more exposure to computer science topics to see if it is something they would want to major in at the post-secondary level.
