INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
Children need to be able to cultivate and foster the skills that will be useful in the future. Students need to be able innovate, create,invent and solve problems we dont even know that we have yet. I can see more and more children just getting so used being handed a device and they are loosing their imagnations and ability to be creative. I have seen through project based learning the good that come from STEM being taught to the youngest of learners. They no longer see materials for what they are they are inventing new and creative ways to use them. They start to think of ways to make things better for the world around them. They also learn to work together with other people and build social emotional skills they may not get with core course work or working with just pencil and paper. 
This applicant likes work environments that are:
	* Creative work
	* Collaborative work
	* Has a structured environment
	* Has the opportunity for you to lead a small team
	* Expect workers to be self-driven
	* Task-oriented work
	* Research or investigative work

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* No specific preference - anything goes!

Other interesting experience:
Last year I was able to work as an extern for Micron helping facilitate the Chip camps at BSU and CWI. This was a great experience of being able to learn so much from the actual professionals working in the filed and to hear and see first hand what these fields  value. I loved working with the diverse group of students. One really awesome take away was to be able to take all the things I had learned working with these professionals and even students that were above the grade level I currently teach with was to find ways to take the activities and the information and adapt them to the elementary model. I was able to modify and deconstruct the process to share with my home school skills per developmental age group to build them up to the skills that the they needed to have in the upper grade levels. I learned so much. 

I have worked summer STEAM, afterschool programming, and migrant summer for my school for the past 5 years.  All of the programming we did was project based and hands on learning. We planned field trips to build on the units we were learning about so that students could see what they learned in real life.  Some examples were engineering challenges, using math to solve real life problems, they used reading skills, they had to be creative and innovative and push themselves to solve problems.  One big take away was as I mentioned before, these kids experienced working as a team, some of them really struggled at first to be able to listen to others ideas or to have to take turns. I felt like this was a great thing to learn since so much of what we do as adults is working with others to make amazing things happen. I feel like if we continue to teach hands on learning and STEM from early childhood then each year they can build on their skills. I have had classes adopt cows from a dairy farm this year so they can learn more about the dairy industry, worked out ways for our school of about 350 kids to build and design things from recycled materials. 

One personal story is when I was teaching area and perimeter to my third grade class and I had a student who really struggled with math and had some strong behaviors.  Teaching math in the traditional way was not working. I found a learning project that he could apply and cnnect to the real life construction of a home. When he applied the math concepts to what interested him in building this little tiny house with simple materials but using the math skills he was learning he excelled and loved math.  

I coordinate with the BAM Boise Art Musuem to coordinate our schools art outreach, Cadlwell Arts community art project, setting up STEM opportunites with Universtiy of Idaho extension for robots and lego. We have set up events with the library, etc. Anything that I can bring to my small school to enrich the students lives. my school is a very low income school and many of the students are just not exposed to STEM or have an opportunity to see STEM careers in action. I beleive having an oppotunity to keep bringing STEM to my school will help the students who really thrive in hands on learning an opportunity to shine.
