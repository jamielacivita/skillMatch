Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Through work at the Foothills Learning Center, the extern will be exposed to many aspects of Environmental Science: from environmental education to land management to ecological restoration. In addition, many of the summer camp programs incorporate STEM concepts in an outdoor learning environment where place-based inquiry drives learning.

Network growth:
	* FLC is a center for many natural resource professionals such as the City of Boise's Restoration Specialist and the trail manager and crews for the Ridge to Rivers trail system.
