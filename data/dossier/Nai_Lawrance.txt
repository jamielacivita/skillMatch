INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I'm excited to learn from leading companies and experts in STEM fields and gain first-hand experience with curriculum, instruction, and real-world applications of science and technology.. This will fuel my own passion for STEM education and make my teaching more engaging and relevant.  Last summer I had an amazing experience working with Micron and its summer camps, and I developed a lot of great lessons and understanding of STEM careers that I was able to take back to the classroom. Additionally, by sharing my own experience and interactions with professionals in the field, I hope to inspire my students to consider STEM careers and show them the diverse pathways available as well as look to implement the knowledge gained through hands-on projects and research opportunities into my curriculum, offering students a more active and engaging learning experience in STEM.
