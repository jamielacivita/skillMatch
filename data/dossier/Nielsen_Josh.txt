INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
I continue to thoroughly enjoy the profession of teaching and working with the youth in geography and in gifted education. I attempt to make the content relevant and enjoyable with an emphasis on discovery and expanding one's understanding through cultures and travel. I want to make learning about this wonderful world a focus for all my students. Having real world experience in a STEM profession would continue to support what I constantly profess about being part of the solution to solving some of our most pressing issues, while maintaining balance and enjoying life. Learners need to see more of the amazing options they have regarding professions, and the hope garnered by professionals making new discoveries and changing the world. Teachers should be a part of that front line as well. I have worked in a number of areas throughout my life and done some amazing things in various fields - these have always added to my ability to motivate students and share a vision of a sustainable future and better world. This on hands experience would supply me with new insights and experience I could again bring to the classroom. Student learners need to see their teachers in learning experiences as well. Living should be about life-long learning.
