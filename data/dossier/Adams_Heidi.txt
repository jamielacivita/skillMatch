INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
Most of the students I teach in my chemistry courses are going into either health care or agricultural fields.  My background is research biochemistry, which overlaps with health care, but not in the clinical sense.  I have near zero background with agriculture.  I see an externship as a possible mini-sabbatical to refresh, gain a new perspective, and bring more real-world examples into the classroom.
