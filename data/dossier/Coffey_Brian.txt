INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I started my teaching career as an English guy. I was a history major in college. I love a good story. For the past two years, I have been teaching math in the Special Ed department at Nampa High and from what I can see, the best stories for students are happening in the STEM world. I don't really know what it's like out there though, and I would love to be able to have more informed conversations with my students about what skills and knowledge they will need to make their best stories come to fruition.
This applicant likes work environments that are:
	* Creative work
	* Research or investigative work
	* Expect workers to be self-driven
	* Comfort with ambiguity needed

	* No specific preference - anything goes!

Other interesting experience:
Before I was a teacher, I was a practicing attorney both in law firms and on my own. I was a volunteer ski instructor for kids and adults with physical and cognitive disabilities for a few years. I was a volunteer youth sports coach mostly in soccer, but basketball and volleyball as well. I have an interest in how we can use science to improve nutrition, reduce disease and generally improve the quality of life for humans and all of our living cohabitants of earth (I mean plants and animals, not aliens), but mostly humans. I am worried about all of the carbon humans are pumping into the atmosphere but I can only hold my breath for so long. I am frequently surprised at how difficult it is for humans to implement science-based solutions that seem like a good idea but also seem like they'd get in the way of other humans making money or maintaining power.
