Why they want to be a part of this program:
First I get to work with some amazing colleagues that are excited about STEM in Idaho.  The reason I chose education as my second career was to get deeply involved in creating and promoting hands-on STEM lessons and activities, this program matches that drive. 

Secondly, there is just not enough time during the school year to properly develop engaging and exciting laboratory experiments and lessons.  I am hoping to complete at least five lessons next summer with support from the host (hopefully Angela Miller from Idaho Power!). 

Students will benefit by having my experiences and lessons help them master the NGSS standards which will be solidly met by the lessons I will help build, but I think the most valuable asset to creating engaging lessons is the WOW factor.  Getting students excited about science comes from the lightbulb moments when students figure out how a little part of our universe works. If students are excited about coming to class to learn they are primed for their future.
