INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Currently, as a second-year teacher, my primary instructional discipline currently lies in English & Language Arts (Writing Composition / Reading Instruction, specifically). Fortunately, as the 2023-2024 academic year began, my administration offered me a very advantageous opportunity to teach one block designated to sixth grade Digital Tools. A similar, yet somewhat irrelevant, opportunity was offered, and graciously accepted, to teach a seventh grade Exploratory Health course. Although I feel like my knowledge and expertise regarding these various disciplines (general literacy, digital competence / safety, and knowledge that allow teens to live effective, healthy lives) are swiftly improving, I feel like this program would provide integral tools and techniques that could significantly improve my ability to not only bestow interest but also direct students in various STEM-related endeavors they may not have considered, previously. In my opinion, the most practical and timely method in achieving this realistic and extremely attainable objective is direct participation in this particular STEM Externship. Of course, as I previously described, I've only exhibited a relatively minimal amount of time formally teaching, I strongly believe I have the proper discipline, resilience and motivation to succeed through this unique experience.
