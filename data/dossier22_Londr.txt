ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
We are an app based, on-demand laundry service marketplace with customers across the U.S. For STEM careers, this would apply to people who want to learn more about how software companies are built and grow. It includes learning about the technology, the operations, marketing and finance of Londr. 

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Operations efficiency (depending on the educator, it can be modified to fit their strength or desires)

Objectives
	* Researching and creating ways to optimize efficiency and customer growth. That could be through operations, marketing, sales or technolgy.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* It will absolutely vary, especially depending on the strengths and desires of the extern. We want them to do what they would enjoy but what is also impactful for us. Because we are a startup, we juggle lots of tasks from different areas. It could include computer research and reports, writing and testing emails, creating and texting social media posts, learning our CRM software and discover  improvements, reviewing our materials to suggest improvements, looking at our website or apps and recommend improvements and rank them in priority, and more.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* The biggest takeaway that the Extern had last year was for his Engineering students to understand that it isn't just about building the product and is so much more than that. It's how to get it to the market and how to make money that is the hardest part. For the "M" in STEM, data analysis and finance are a huge focus because learning how to evaluate data and make meaningful assumptions that will lead to improved outcomes is essential to success. For finance, we have to manage cash flow, and make sure we are profitable. We have to project into the future on costs and growth to attract investors or determine other ways to acquire funds to grow. Consumer behavior (Science-Psychology) is also a key component to effective communication and product development. 

Network growth:
	* We attend a number of community entrepreneur events where they can meet other entrepreneurs. We have software developers, financial advisors, marketing consultants that are all great sources of information about careers. 

Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;If they know how to code or modify websites or graphic design, that is a plus!;
