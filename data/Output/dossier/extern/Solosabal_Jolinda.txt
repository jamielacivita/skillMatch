INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* A summer internship can provide valuable growth opportunities that enhance my teaching skills and bring fresh benefits to my students. Internships can provide hands-on experience that can deepen my knowledge and help make my lessons more relatable and current for my students. Engaging in a new environments can help develop skills like collaboration, problem-solving, and adapting to different work cultures. These transferable skills can enrich my teaching practices. Working outside education exposes me to different approaches to leadership, teamwork, and innovation, which I can incorporate into my classroom management and teaching strategies. Building relationships with professionals in other fields can lead to partnerships for guest speakers, field trips, or mentorship opportunities for my students to enhance their learning. Real-world insights can help me design projects or lessons that are more aligned with current trends and practical applications, keeping learning engaging and relevant for my students. By taking on an internship, I will demonstrate to my students that growth and learning continue throughout life. This will enspire them to continue to learn.
