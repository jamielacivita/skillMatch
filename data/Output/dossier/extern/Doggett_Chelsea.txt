Applicant : Doggett, Chelsea
School (district) : Midvale School  (Midvale School District 433)
Role(s) : Early Elementary Teacher (K-2nd);
LinkedIn Profile : I have a degree in Childrens Psychology and that alone has helped me tremendously in teaching. I worked with underprivilaged children as a Cognitive Behaviroal Therapist prior to becoming a teacher. I have coached T-Ball and Coach pitch the last several years as well. I am the President of our non-profit Pool Board in our community where a board of us collaborate to do fundraisers to keep the local pool operational and open. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an early educater I'm always seeking continued education to build my knowledge bank. That allows me to expand and enrich the learning experience for our very remote rural school district students. Buidling my knowledge of STEM and bringing it into my classroom provides opportunities for my students to experience content not directly reachable from our location and broadens their idea of the world outside of our small town. STEM also draws students in as it gives meaning and reason behind learning, it allows them to connect the importance of their educaiton to their future careers. I'd be honored to get to participate in this externship. I'm a mom of two young learners so the remote option best suits my availability. I'm a life long learner and really enjoy learning and collaborating with other educaters.
