INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I already volunteer in youth programs outside of school and notice that many times I am adapting the "lesson or activity" to the age and group.  I use my educational knowledge about kids and how they learn to ensure it is engaging and age/level appropriate.  Furthermore, there are so many different programs/community members that have many ideas/programs/expertise to offer and I often don't get to hear/see all that could be included in the classroom, this can help with that.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
