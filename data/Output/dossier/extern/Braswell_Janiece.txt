INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I participated in this program last summer and really enjoyed the experience and opportunity to develop STEAM activities for my host site and also implement them into my classroom this year.  I know it will benefit me as an educator because it requires me to "think outside of the box" and get creative in problem solving and coming up with new ideas and activities to enrich curriculum.  It will also benefit my students because they rarely get to participate in STEAM activities so this opportunity will give me a way to ensure that I can integrate the things I learn through the externship into my classroom.
