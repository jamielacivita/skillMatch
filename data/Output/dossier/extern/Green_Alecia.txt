INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Public schools can expose kids to STEM who otherwise would not get to enjoy STEM experiences. For example, I teach in a low income school, and my 4th grade class this year has completed several LEGO STEM projects (the LEGO sets were provided by the Idaho Department of Education); during one of these projects, a boy said to me, "I always knew about LEGOS, but I never got to play with any before. They're great!"

Public schools are also ideal for STEM outreach because these activities are so engaging for such a broad spectrum of students; for instance, a girl in my class  who is typically very shy but highly intelligent, comes alive during our LEGO and Mystery Science curriculum, she steps up and happily engages with her peers, often leading her group in a way that is both sensitive and innovative. However, it isn't just intellectual but shy students who engage with STEM activities in my classroom, my academically struggling students also come alive with STEM activities, suddenly happy to give answers and engage in building and drawing projects. 

STEM instruction in classrooms can help meet the needs of all learners, can create cross-curricular activities, can add rigor for students who are excelling, but can also excite and support struggling students, so I am always looking for ways to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world applications. Gaining hands-on experience in how STEM is applied in the workplace would provide invaluable insight that I can bring back to my students. Also, by understanding the practical applications of STEM concepts, I can better design lessons that connect to career pathways, inspire curiosity, and demonstrate the relevance of these skills in solving real-world challenges.

Additionally, meeting STEM professionals from diverse backgrounds will allow me to share stories of their journeys with my students, helping them see the wide range of possibilities in STEM fields. Learning what employers value when hiring STEM employees will also guide me in preparing my students with the skills, mindsets, and experiences they need to be competitive in the workforce. This opportunity will help me create a more engaging and purposeful STEM curriculum, ensuring my students are prepared for future success.
