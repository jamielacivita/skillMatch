INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I teach both 8th grade Science and the AVID Elective, which focuses on early college and career readiness. I hope to gain work experiences that I can not only bring back to my classroom, but also share with my former students, so that they can successfully pursue meaningful careers. 8th grade is an essential time to expose students to this information because they are beginning to plan their high school classes and prepare for future careers. 

I have had excellent experiences in the past two years working for St. Alphonsus in the Talent Acquisition Dept and have brought my students the importance of 20th century skills, essential work habits, and share career opportunities with current and former students. The Externship experiences have been invaluable and I look forward to bringing new ideas and experiences back to my classroom.
