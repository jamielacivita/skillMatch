INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I think it would be good for me to have some experience in the workforce in fields where we are often sending students. I feel that we are often telling them what to expect from a career field and what will be expected of them in that career field, but I have little experience in those fields to really know firsthand the expectations.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.)

Other interesting experience:
I have helped as a volunteer in multiple sporting events including tournaments and camps. I also am an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I served two years in Mexico as a full-time missionary. I have served in several volunteer leadership capacities working with youth of all ages and adults. I currently serve as a Bishop as well.

I grew up on a ranch and currently help part-time on two ranches (that work probably counts as volunteer and non-education work because they are both family ranches; one owned by my parents and the other by my in-laws). I also work a few summers in the roofing industry and have done some part time work in the construction industry helping other family members with cabinet, electrical, flooring, and other construction type projects. 

I feel I bring some valuable skillsets to the table to help any organization, but I am also open to being stretched and learning new things.
