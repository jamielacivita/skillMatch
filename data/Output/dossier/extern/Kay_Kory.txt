INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I think it would be good for me to have some experience in the workforce in fields where we are often sending students. I feel that we are often telling them what to expect from a career field and what will be expected of them in that career field, but I have little experience in those fields to really know firsthand the expectations.

OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIENCE:
I have helped as a volunteer in multiple sporting events including tournaments and camps. I also am an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I served two years in Mexico as a full-time missionary. I have served in several volunteer leadership capacities working with youth of all ages and adults. I currently serve as a Bishop as well.

I grew up on a ranch and currently help part-time on two ranches (that work probably counts as volunteer and non-education work because they are both family ranches; one owned by my parents and the other by my in-laws). I also work a few summers in the roofing industry and have done some part time work in the construction industry helping other family members with cabinet, electrical, flooring, and other construction type projects. 

I feel I bring some valuable skillsets to the table to help any organization, but I am also open to being stretched and learning new things.
