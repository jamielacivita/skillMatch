INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am interested in participating in a summer internship to bring fresh ideas to the classroom. My interests lie in nature, plants, and horticulture, and I truly enjoy working with children and adults. Additionally, I have experience working with refugees through a Newcomers Center, which has deepened my understanding of diverse perspectives.
This internship presents a great opportunity for me to gain new experiences and skills that I can bring back to our classroom. Thank you for considering my interest in this endeavor.
