INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I want to participate in the program to help me integrate engaging STEM activities in my classroom.  As a professional teacher, I am always looking for new opportunities to improve my craft and create a fun and safe learning environment.  This program could benefit my students in many ways.  It will create hands-on activities that all students can participate in.  Rupert Elementary is in a very poor area and kids do not get to experience a lot of things.  This program will give me the knowledge and experience to give my students exciting new ways to learn.

Other interesting experience:
When I taught the migrant summer school program, I used lots of STEM activities to enhance their learning experience.  I have done smores in a solar oven that we created to cook them in, they were so excited to do hands-on activities.  It is hard to incorporate STEM into our day, there never seems to be enough time.  I would love to learn different ways to merge STEM activities into our curriculum.
