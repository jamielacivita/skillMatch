Applicant : Clarke, Rachael
School (district) : White Pine Charter School (White Pine Charter Schools)
Role(s) : Early Elementary Teacher (K-2nd);
LinkedIn Profile : I have worked with children in daycare, preschool, and elementary settings for a decade now. Beyond teaching, I am very outdoorsy and nature oriented. I love incorporating the outdoors into the classroom experience when I can. I have experience with running nature themed after school clubs and summer camps. I also love art and reading, and all kinds of animals. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* For the last two years, I have been a part of my school's STEM accreditation team, which is working towards getting our school STEM certified. I love being a part of the team and learning about more ways to bring STEM into the classroom, as well as documenting the ways we already include STEM in our teaching. I know that an externship would bring me greater insight for my classroom as well as my team. In first grade, the science subjects we focus on are the human body, earth, space, and animals and habitats. Participating in an externship that includes any of those topics would greatly enhance my teaching of those units. I would love to be considered and am open to many different roles. I look forward to making connections with other individuals and organizations in my community.

I have worked with children in daycare, preschool, and elementary settings for a decade now. Beyond teaching, I am very outdoorsy and nature oriented. I love incorporating the outdoors into the classroom experience when I can. I have experience with running nature themed after school clubs and summer camps. I also love art and reading, and all kinds of animals.

Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* For the last two years, I have been a part of my school's STEM accreditation team, which is working towards getting our school STEM certified. I love being a part of the team and learning about more ways to bring STEM into the classroom, as well as documenting the ways we already include STEM in our teaching. I know that an externship would bring me greater insight for my classroom as well as my team. In first grade, the science subjects we focus on are the human body, earth, space, and animals and habitats. Participating in an externship that includes any of those topics would greatly enhance my teaching of those units. I would love to be considered and am open to many different roles. I look forward to making connections with other individuals and organizations in my community.

I have worked with children in daycare, preschool, and elementary settings for a decade now. Beyond teaching, I am very outdoorsy and nature oriented.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* For the last two years, I have been a part of my school's STEM accreditation team, which is working towards getting our school STEM certified. I love being a part of the team and learning about more ways to bring STEM into the classroom, as well as documenting the ways we already include STEM in our teaching. I know that an externship would bring me greater insight for my classroom as well as my team. In first grade, the science subjects we focus on are the human body, earth, space, and animals and habitats. Participating in an externship that includes any of those topics would greatly enhance my teaching of those units. I would love to be considered and am open to many different roles. I look forward to making connections with other individuals and organizations in my community.
