INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* My college degree is in mathematics education, but I have always loved engineering in my spare time. I was so excited when I found out that I could combine the two and teach engineering! It has now been 6 years since I started teaching pre-engineering classes for the West Ada School District, and I haven't looked back.

However, due to my background in education, I feel that I am lacking valuable industry experience and connections which would greatly benefit my students. The Idaho Educator Externship Program seems to be EXACTLY what I need to help my students network with industry professionals, as well as develop my technical skills by working to solve real-world problems.
