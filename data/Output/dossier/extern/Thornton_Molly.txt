Other interesting experience:
Iâve been a yearbook advisor for 5 years, which has taught me a lot about collaboration, creativity, and managing complex projects. Iâve also been a soccer coach for 11 years, where Iâve developed leadership and team-building skills. Outside of work, I have a deep love for reading and spending time outdoors, which keeps me inspired and balanced. These experiences have shaped my ability to connect with people and adapt to different challenges, and Iâm excited to bring that to this externship.
