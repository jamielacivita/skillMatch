LinkedIn Profile : I was born and raised in the Bronx, NYC. I am a dual citizen of the United States and Ireland. I lived and taught in Ireland for 2 years, where I married my husband. Boise is my favorite city in the world. I love Idaho it's home. I graduated from BSU. Go Broncos! I am a foodie and love to try new restaurants.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am excited about the opportunity to be part of the STEM externship program because I believe it will help me bring more real-world STEM experiences to my students. As an elementary educator who teaches virtually, I think it is important to show students how STEM works in the community outside of our online classroom. This program will give me a chance to see STEM in action right here in the Treasure Valley and learn from local professionals who are doing amazing things in science, technology, engineering, and math.

By participating in this externship, I hope to gain new ideas and resources to make STEM more engaging and accessible for my students. I want to show them how STEM is not just something we talk about in class, but something thats happening in their own community. I believe that learning about local STEM careers and seeing how they connect to the world around them will inspire my students and help them see how exciting STEM can be in their future.

This experience will help me grow as an educator and, more importantly, help my students develop a deeper understanding and love for STEM subjects. I look forward to bringing back what I learn and sharing it with my students to make learning even more meaningful.
