INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* My interest primarily is to help with the senior project program, a requirement for the state of Idaho which influences students post-high school plans through research of talents and interests to guide their future choices in the college and career field.

The other benefits to this program are to incorporate other curriculums/subjects for cross curricular purposes in the classroom that will enhance my subject area. I hope to influence students who struggle with the English curriculum to find a good medium in STEM areas that can help influence their interests in the study of informational/expository texts/ideas as well as spark their regard for higher education.
