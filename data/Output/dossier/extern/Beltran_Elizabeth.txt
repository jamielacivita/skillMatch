INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Participating in an externship is a unique opportunity to polish my skills and learn new ones. Working outside of my comfort zone will allow me to grow and apply my skills in ways I have never done before, making me more confident. As an educator, it is easy to stay within the confines of theoretical content. However, putting my skills into action in a different environment will help me improve my teaching strategies by incorporating more real-life scenarios and applications.

I often hear my students ask, "How am I going to use this in real life?" or "Why do I have to learn this?" By experiencing the "real world," I will be able to provide my students with fresh insights and practical applications. This externship will help me connect their school experience to the real world, making learning more relevant and engaging for them. I expect that this experience will motivate and inspire my students about learning and preparing for the future.

OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIENCE:
All my life I knew I wanted a career related to STEM. Before I decided to teach, I wanted to study either Mechatronic or Mechanical Engineering. I love to learn, problem-solve, and my favorite subjects to learn about are related to Math and Physics; I have a lot of fun figuring answers to that type of problems. I consider myself artistic. I like to paint in my free time (I am not that good, but I enjoy it) and I like to design as well. Not an expert, but I enjoy arranging colors, fonts, pictures, and making them work.
