INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* At Anser, our learning framework is based on fieldwork and student experiences.  I can take students into our local communities to research, see, and experience what we learn in the classroom.  Students also have the opportunity to go into the community and teach others what they have learned.  As a teacher, this model is transformative, and learning new skills in other settings outside of education is very important to me.  It allows me to build a network to provide our students with new opportunities. 

I am currently a 4th-grade teacher.  We study life science and focus on Idaho Sage Brush Ecosystems.  I also study the Oregon trail and Idhao history.  We have extensive discussions on technology, how much the world has changed in a few 100 years, and how our environment has changed because of technology.  I would be so excited to intern at a place where I can make connections to Idaho history and agriculture. It is so important to help students connect our past to our present and future.  It helps them better understand what and why and guides them to new areas to explore. My current class is interested in geothermal technology, communication, transportation, conservation of rivers and land, power and dams, farming, economics (supply and demand), medicine, transportation, and archeology.  

I am in my 7th year of teaching. I have taught 5th, 2nd, and 4th grade.  I am currently a 4th-grade teacher.  I live rurally in Prama and commute 30 miles to school each way.  I have horses and a garden, and I am interested in Ag!  I have spent time around a dairy farm, horse farms, and trucking.  
I enjoy developing curriculum, professional development, and data analysis at school. I led the school-wide behavior team.  As a part of that team, I built a staff website with resources, lessons, videos, and our data-tracking spreadsheet.  I have some experience with video creation and editing.  I also have experience in event planning, online learning platforms, and training staff.  

I completed my first master's in 2018.  I completed a research study on classroom management.  Last May, I completed my second master's in Educational Leadership at BSU.  Through that process, I learned I am interested in curriculum coaching and project management and still love data!
