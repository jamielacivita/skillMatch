INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Participating in a STEM externship as an ELA teacher presents a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between traditionally distinct disciplines and equip students with critical skills needed for the future. In todays world, communication and critical thinking are just as vital in STEM fields as technical knowledge. By immersing in a STEM environment, I can uncover innovative ways to integrate storytelling, analytical reading, and persuasive writing into science, technology, engineering, and math curricula. This interdisciplinary approach not only strengthens students ability to articulate complex ideas but also prepares them to excel in a workforce that demands collaboration and effective communication across diverse fields.

Bridging STEM and ELA is particularly crucial in fostering inclusivity and engagement. Students who may feel intimidated by the technical nature of STEM subjects can find a voice through ELA skills such as narrative writing or presenting findings in a compelling way. Additionally, this connection helps develop well-rounded learners who can analyze scientific data, construct evidence-based arguments, and convey technical concepts to varied audiences. By participating in a STEM externship, I hope I can bring real-world examples and experiences back to the classroom, demonstrating to students how literacy and communication are indispensable tools in solving global challenges and innovating for the future.
