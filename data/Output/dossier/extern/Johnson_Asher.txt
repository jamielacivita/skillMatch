Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am excited to apply for the 2025 Summer Externship Program because I am passionate about integrating real-world STEM and career experiences into my kindergarten classroom. As an educator, I constantly seek opportunities to grow professionally and enhance my teaching strategies. This program offers a unique chance to collaborate with industry leaders, gaining insights and hands-on experience that I can translate into meaningful, age-appropriate learning experiences for my young students.

By participating, I aim to deepen my understanding of STEM applications and workforce trends, which will allow me to inspire curiosity and foundational skills in my students at an early age. Building these connections between classroom learning and the broader world is essential for helping students envision their future possibilities, even at the kindergarten level.

Additionally, the $5,000 stipend and the opportunity to earn professional development credits will support my professional growth and further equip me with tools to innovate in my teaching practice. I am eager to bring back fresh perspectives and practical knowledge to not only benefit my students but also share with colleagues to strengthen our collective approach to education.

This program aligns with my commitment to fostering curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning in young minds while preparing them for a rapidly evolving future. Thank you for considering my application.
