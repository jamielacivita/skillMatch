INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.

Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.)

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.)

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.)

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* While I do not teach science or math, I do teach US Government and Media Literacy. I can see this benefitting me as an educator and my students in the following ways. First, partnering with different organizations in the community is beneficial to civics education. It would build bridges between my students and the community and allow them to have a practical experience that is engaged with the community they live in. They can see the impact government policy has on organizations, or even find ways to serve their community through the organization. 

Second, I would love to find an organization that focuses on media. I saw that previous interns worked with CBS or GuardRailz (which deals with AI). If I  could work with a media organization, it would better equip me with skills in video production and media analysis, but more importantly it would be help students acquire professional skills, discern the quality of information, and  help them understand the psychological and even emotional impacts of media and media addiction.  I imagine  these media related companies visit my class to instruct the students directly on these matters as well.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.) 
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* Anything Media related (news media or production) or audio/video related
