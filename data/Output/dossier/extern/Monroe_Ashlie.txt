Applicant : Monroe, Ashlie
School (district) : Endeavor Elementary (Nampa School District)
Role(s) : Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);
LinkedIn Profile : I worked at Saint Alphonsus for 8 years prior to teaching. Working in a hospital gave me invaluable exposure to various medical departments and processes, allowing me to observe the interconnected roles of healthcare professionals in delivering patient care. I had the opportunity to work alongside doctors, nurses, and specialists, gaining insight into their expertise and how they collaborate to create comprehensive treatment plans. This experience enhanced my understanding of medical procedures, patient care protocols, and the importance of interdisciplinary teamwork in achieving positive health outcomes. It provided a well-rounded perspective on the dynamic nature of the healthcare environment and deepened my appreciation for the complexities of medical practice.

Watching my husband run his electrical company has given me valuable insight into the contracting and electrical fields. Ive gained a better understanding of the planning, organization, and problem-solving required to manage projects effectively, from bidding jobs to coordinating timelines and ensuring safety compliance. Observing his work has also taught me about the technical aspects of electrical systems, the importance of quality craftsmanship, and how to build strong client relationships. This exposure has provided me with a practical perspective on the industry and an appreciation for the skills and expertise involved in the trade.
