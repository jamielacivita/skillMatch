INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have the privilege of teaching 4th and 5th grade science for North Star Charter Elementary and I am the Science Lead Teacher for the Elementary School. I believe this experience would help me to broaden my expertise and knowledge and allow me to bring what I learn to my school where I work with educators K-12. I also believe what I learn would benefit my students as I apply what I learn directly into my classroom. We have a strong science program but I am always looking for ways I can improve it for my school and my students.
