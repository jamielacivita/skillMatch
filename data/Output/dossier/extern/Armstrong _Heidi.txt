INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have had colleagues that have gone through this program that have gained a lot of things to help them in their classroom I believe that STEM is something that a lot of us teachers lack in our classroom. Its hard to know when and how to incorporate a STEM activity or relate different things being learned to STEM. I hope that this will help me gain insight in teaching my students with my hands on activities. I might be able to realize different academics being used in their field that I am trying to teach in my class. I hope that I will be able to gain more insight on helping them become successful adults and in their future careers.
