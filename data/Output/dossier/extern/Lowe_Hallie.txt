INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator I'm always having to explain to my students why the things we talk about in class matter in the world around us. Students want to know how science will play a role in their future careers, and I hope to gain more experience in work fields where I can see how science impacts the work force. Additionally, I love to learn and am always eager to strengthen my own understanding so that I can be a better educator for my students. If I am able to learn more about STEM by participating in this program, I know it will help my students to have a better perspective based on the things I will learn.
