INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Being part of this program is a natural extension of my passion for fostering critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, both for myself and for students. As an educator, I believe that the integration of STEM concepts into teaching can benefit me by deepening my own understanding of technology, engineering, mathematics, and science in ways that are both practical and innovative. These fields are constantly evolving, and participating in a STEM program would allow me to stay up-to-date with new teaching strategies, tools, and best practices. It will also help me to improve my ability to guide students in applying these concepts to real-world situations, encouraging them to become more engaged and motivated learners.
