INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	*  By participating in an externship, I can gain firsthand knowledge of technologies and best practices.  I can stay current and enrich my curriculum with the content I will learn during my externship.  Creating a strong connection to industries will build relationships and partnerships that I will utilize throughout the school year in my classroom.  I will gain insights through my externship that will allow me to discover ways to explain or teach based on real world needs.  Exposure to current industry can help my curriculum to become more relevant and give better support to my students and coworkers.  Personally, I can sharpen my own skills to contribute to career satisfaction and open doors to new opportunities and also networking opportunities.  The externship will benefit myself and my students with real world applications and experiences.  The skills I can bring to the classroom with hands-on level learning by myself and businesses will foster a deeper learning commitment from my students.
