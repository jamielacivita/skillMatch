Applicant : Spencer, Brittney
School (district) : Tiebreaker Elementary (Bonneville Joint School Dist. 93)
Role(s) : Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);
LinkedIn Profile : I have been fortunate to contribute to my community through a variety of volunteer experiences that reflect my passion for working with children and fostering growth. Ive spent hours volunteering at day camps, summer daycare programs, and tutoring sessions, where Ive had the privilege of supporting children as they learn, play, and develop new skills. Additionally, Ive enjoyed sewing costumes for performances, teaching choir, and leading church Bible study groups, all of which have allowed me to combine creativity with education.
Reading is another passion of mine, and I firmly believe in the importance of lifelong learning. Whether its through sharing stories with students or guiding them toward new discoveries, I strive to inspire a love of learning and curiosity in those I work with. These experiences have shaped my teaching philosophy and continue to drive my commitment to helping others grow.
