INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* This program would help me to become a more well-rounded educator. The more experiences I can pull from and into my teaching will lend to better education. I will be able to share new ideas and concepts with my students they may never get the experience to see or learn otherwise. I want my students to see as much of the world as possible while in my classroom whether that be through new technology, experiences, or visits by community members through connections made by myself outside of the classroom. The bigger I can make the world for my students the the bigger the buy-in there is in their learning and ultimately the better citizens they will be within their community. I want to help raise lifelong learners and that starts with me.
