INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I want to be part of this program so that I have real, tangible answers to my students asking me "when will I ever use this in real life???". I am also constantly working to improve my own skillset and knowledge base, so that I can provide more in-depth and comprehensive explanations to my students. By working in this externship program, I will also be able to work closer with industries outside of education to better connect with not only my students who have family working in those industries, but also to connect with those family members to foster strong community networks for my school.
