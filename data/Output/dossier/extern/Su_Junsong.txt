Applicant : Su, Junsong
School (district) : South Fork Elementary School (Jefferson School District #251)
Role(s) : Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);4th and 5th grade robotics;
LinkedIn Profile : Outside the classroom, I have enjoyed a variety of experiences that have enriched my teaching and broadened my perspective. I have taught an afterschool 3D printing class, which allowed me to introduce students to cutting-edge technology and foster their creativity. Currently, I am teaching a VEX IQ robotics class, where students learn about engineering and programming through hands-on activities.

In addition to my teaching roles, I took a course about front-end software development, which has enhanced my technical skills and understanding of the digital world. I have also participated in numerous i-STEM teacher professional development courses, which have provided me with valuable insights and strategies for integrating STEM education into my curriculum.

Beyond education, I have experience as a newspaper reporter and photographer. These roles have honed my communication skills and attention to detail, and they have given me a unique perspective on storytelling and capturing moments.

These diverse experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skill set and a passion for continuous learning, which I believe will help me connect with the right hosts and bring valuable insights back to my students.


INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an immersion Chinese 4th grade teacher at South Fork Elementary, I teach science and math in Chinese. During my tenure, I have observed a gap between what students learn in school and how they can apply that knowledge to real life. Often, students memorize concepts without understanding their relevance, learning just to pass tests rather than seeing the meaningful connections to their lives.

I believe that participating in The Idaho Educator Externship Program will help me bridge this gap. By gaining a deeper understanding of how different science and math concepts are used in various industries, I can bring real-world applications into my classroom. This will not only enhance my teaching but also make learning more engaging and relevant for my students.

Additionally, I hope to build long-term relationships with my host and potentially establish partnerships that allow students to see firsthand how the knowledge they acquire in school is applied in future careers. This exposure will inspire them and provide a clearer vision of how their education can impact their lives and the world around them.

Ultimately, this program will benefit both my professional growth and my students' learning experiences, fostering a deeper connection between classroom concepts and real-world applications.
