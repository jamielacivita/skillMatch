Applicant : Randall, Allyson
School (district) : Riverside Elementary (Boise)
Role(s) : Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);Early Elementary Teacher (K-2nd);
LinkedIn Profile : I love coaching the rock climbing team at the Commons Climbing Gym. I have enjoyed coaching cross country and track. I really enjoyed my externship experience with the hydrotech team at the USGS Water Science Center two summers ago! I've worked as an outdoor guide in the past and have been working to bring that back into my classroom work again, so very interested in all things conservation, environmental, naturalist, etc. related.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have so enjoyed my diverse past experiences with the externship program. I got to engage in a job very different from my teaching role both summers I was involved, but then got to meet people doing such awesome work and bring that directly into my work in the classroom. This year, I have had units that integrated the work from both my externships and my students love to hear about the real world experience that I had in those topics. I have loved just getting more involved in my community and work spaces outside of public education to be able to draw on that experience as a public educator.
