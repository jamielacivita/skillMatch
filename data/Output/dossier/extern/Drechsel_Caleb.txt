Applicant : Drechsel, Caleb
School (district) : Lake City High School (Coeur d'Alene School District 271)
Role(s) : High School Teacher;Coach, club-leader, tech-leader;
LinkedIn Profile : I grew up and worked on a 2000+ acre family farm through college. 
I coach competitive Speech and Debate, where I manage 40+ students and host multiday tournaments with 200+ attendees. 
I host an afterschool Gaming Club where I Game Master (roleplay) experiences with students. I base these "games" off of stories and challenges that encourage students to use their skills to work together and address bigger questions like conflict-management, law and justice, etc. 
I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom. 


INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to partner in this program to create engaging simulations and immersive experiences that are accessible and manageable by community partners regardless of technology and supplies. I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.) 
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)

Other interesting experience:
I grew up and worked on a 2000+ acre family farm through college. 
I coach competitive Speech and Debate, where I manage 40+ students and host multiday tournaments with 200+ attendees. 
I host an afterschool Gaming Club where I Game Master (roleplay) experiences with students. I base these "games" off of stories and challenges that encourage students to use their skills to work together and address bigger questions like conflict-management, law and justice, etc. 
I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to partner in this program to create engaging simulations and immersive experiences that are accessible and manageable by community partners regardless of technology and supplies. I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging.

Other interesting experience:
I grew up and worked on a 2000+ acre family farm through college. 
I coach competitive Speech and Debate, where I manage 40+ students and host multiday tournaments with 200+ attendees. 
I host an afterschool Gaming Club where I Game Master (roleplay) experiences with students. I base these "games" off of stories and challenges that encourage students to use their skills to work together and address bigger questions like conflict-management, law and justice, etc. 
I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to partner in this program to create engaging simulations and immersive experiences that are accessible and manageable by community partners regardless of technology and supplies. I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

Other interesting experience:
I grew up and worked on a 2000+ acre family farm through college. 
I coach competitive Speech and Debate, where I manage 40+ students and host multiday tournaments with 200+ attendees. 
I host an afterschool Gaming Club where I Game Master (roleplay) experiences with students. I base these "games" off of stories and challenges that encourage students to use their skills to work together and address bigger questions like conflict-management, law and justice, etc. 
I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to partner in this program to create engaging simulations and immersive experiences that are accessible and manageable by community partners regardless of technology and supplies. I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.) 
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)

I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to partner in this program to create engaging simulations and immersive experiences that are accessible and manageable by community partners regardless of technology and supplies. I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to partner in this program to create engaging simulations and immersive experiences that are accessible and manageable by community partners regardless of technology and supplies. I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.) 
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to partner in this program to create engaging simulations and immersive experiences that are accessible and manageable by community partners regardless of technology and supplies. I see students benefit from immersive simulations and experiences that take them beyond notes written on worksheets or packets. I remember in my education working with classmates on an elementary town-map rug to manage resources and transportation in a fictious community. We learned about a balanced ecology and the importance of planning emergency responses - all while practicing critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.) 
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)

Other interesting experience:
I grew up and worked on a 2000+ acre family farm through college. 
I coach competitive Speech and Debate, where I manage 40+ students and host multiday tournaments with 200+ attendees. 
I host an afterschool Gaming Club where I Game Master (roleplay) experiences with students. I base these "games" off of stories and challenges that encourage students to use their skills to work together and address bigger questions like conflict-management, law and justice, etc. 
I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.

I foresee future classrooms driven by experiential learning where "research projects" have students exploring local museums, video-calling specialists in their communities, and documenting their own data-gathering instead of simply citing sources from a simple Google search. 
I pride myself in knowing a little bit about everything, but I am pursuing a graduate degree in Educational Technology, with a focus in simulation and gamification theory. My teaching style is driven by immersing students in the content and learning. I use simulations (roleplaying, choose-you-own-adventure, mock trial, etc.) and am fascinated with gamification of assessment (escape rooms, competitive quizzes, tracking student performance, etc.). I connect concepts like grammar to understanding how language models and programming function and often get asked by students, "this is English; why are we talking about science?" or accused of defending math as "the magical, universal language." I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

Other interesting experience:
I grew up and worked on a 2000+ acre family farm through college. 
I coach competitive Speech and Debate, where I manage 40+ students and host multiday tournaments with 200+ attendees. 
I host an afterschool Gaming Club where I Game Master (roleplay) experiences with students. I base these "games" off of stories and challenges that encourage students to use their skills to work together and address bigger questions like conflict-management, law and justice, etc. 
I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.

I thrive in connecting students' interests to the classwork, often adapting the latter to help them (and myself) make their learning more relevant and engaging. My debate students have to learn concepts and relationships in ecology, technology, environment, and policy just to prepare their arguments for tournaments! 
My classroom is just as limited as my students when it is just an isolated prison for a period. The more porous my classroom is - either from guest speakers sharing their passions, to virtual field "trips" to the Lincoln Memorial to find the symbolic "fasces", to once measuring and calculating how many of our school buildings would fit on the Ever Given when it blocked the Suez Canal. In North Idaho especially, our students must see their learning in the context of their community and potential - so that our community can see the value of STEM in public education. 
I thank you for your consideration, and I hope we can collaborate on a project that makes deliverables that empower teachers to connect their students to your program.

Other interesting experience:
I grew up and worked on a 2000+ acre family farm through college. 
I coach competitive Speech and Debate, where I manage 40+ students and host multiday tournaments with 200+ attendees. 
I host an afterschool Gaming Club where I Game Master (roleplay) experiences with students. I base these "games" off of stories and challenges that encourage students to use their skills to work together and address bigger questions like conflict-management, law and justice, etc. 
I volunteer as a tech leader in my building, creating and leading professional development in using classroom technology, apps, and help adapt lessons to maximize student opportunities.  
I have an interest in story writing and game-design, including 3D printing models for these games and personal interests. 
I have lead summer classes on car maintenance and ownership, as well as short, interactive sessions throughout the school year on voting right in Idaho and digital/news literacy through programs like Checkology and the News Literacy Project. 
I am currently working with the Boise Writing Project through the Document Based Inquiry Institute to craft curriculum based on primary documents on historical, social, and STEM concepts. I have created a learning module and will lead a conference session on supporting accountable AI-use in writing for the classroom.
