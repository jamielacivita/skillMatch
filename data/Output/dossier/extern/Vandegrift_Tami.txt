LinkedIn Profile : I do lots of design and implementation in my free time.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I teach at a school with a focus on the arts and humanities but I try to integrate as much STEM experience as possible within my discipline. Currently, I have a 3d printer as a class pet and some grades do a unit on insulators/conductors when we make invented instruments. I want to see how STEM concepts are a part of every day life for all, even artist and musicians.
