INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As a new educator, I am interested in learning as much as I can from a diverse range of sources. Throughout my own education, I tended to focus mainly on english, writing, and the humanities. I would like to improve my knowledge surrounding STEM subjects so that I can better assist my students in subjects other than my own, and so that I can become a more well-rounded educator, mentor, and resource. 
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.) 
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)
	* Life Science / Biology
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Math
	* Physics
	* Chemistry
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
