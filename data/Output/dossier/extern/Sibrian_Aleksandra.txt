Applicant : Sibrian, Aleksandra
School (district) : Wood River Middle School (Blaine County School District NO 61)
Role(s) : Middle School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : I have had the privilege of gaining diverse hands-on experiences in the biomedical field, which I believe would be valuable in connecting with the right hosts. I worked in a hospital transplantology lab, where I genotyped blood samples to match donors and recipients for bone marrow transplants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I conducted PCR-based COVID testing in a genetic laboratory of a public hospital, contributing directly to public health efforts.

As a Fulbright scholar, I spent a year at the University of Idaho in the Bana Jabri Immunology lab, where I conducted research on GATA4 receptors in celiac disease modeled in mice for my masters thesis. After completing my degree, I worked for two years at Santacruz Biotechnology at IdahoBioscience lab in Ketchum, ID, where I focused on the development of monoclonal antibodies.

These roles have equipped me with technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a strong understanding of scientific research and development. I am eager to leverage these experiences to create meaningful connections with hosts and bring real-world STEM applications into my teaching, inspiring students to explore and engage with scientific fields.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* 
As an 8th-grade science teacher, leadership teacher, and GATE facilitator, I am passionate about equipping my students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving world. Participating in the 2025 Summer Externship Program would provide me with invaluable hands-on experience and insights into specialized STEM and career fields, allowing me to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world applications.

By immersing myself in industry practices, I hope to enhance my curriculum with relevant, up-to-date knowledge and create more engaging, career-focused STEM opportunities for my students. This experience would enable me to design lessons and projects that connect scientific principles to practical challenges and innovations, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Additionally, as a leadership teacher and GATE facilitator, I aim to inspire students to explore their passions and develop leadership skills in STEM and beyond. By sharing real-world scenarios and career pathways learned during the externship, I can better guide my students toward future opportunities and empower them to see the relevance of their education in shaping their futures.

Ultimately, this program aligns with my commitment to preparing students not only for academic success but also for meaningful contributions to their communities and careers.
