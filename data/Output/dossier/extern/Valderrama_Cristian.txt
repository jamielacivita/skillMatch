Other interesting experience:
In addition to teaching foreign languages, I have had a strong interest in technology since secondary school, where I gained valuable knowledge about hardware, software, as well as introductory ideas on programming, and databases. Over time, I have empirically developed digital skills in website creation, as well as video and image editing, which I used to manage and promote my small Spanish language school before I paused that project for a while.
