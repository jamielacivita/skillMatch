INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am excited to apply for this program. This externship is a valuable opportunity for both my personal growth as an educator and for the students I serve. I love being a lifelong learner and try to set an example for my students. As a teacher, I strive to stay connected with current industry trends and bring real-world relevance into my classroom. This externship will give me the chance to work alongside industry leaders and gain hands-on experience that I can bring back to my students, helping students better understand the connection between what they are learning and how it applies to their future careers.

By spending time in a STEM-focused environment, I hope to deepen my knowledge of the skills and competencies that are in demand within the workforce. This experience will allow me to bring up-to-date information and industry insights into my teaching, enriching the learning experience for my students. I also hope it will inspire students to think more critically about the careers they may pursue and help them see the broad range of opportunities available in STEM fields.

This opportunity will help me build relationships with STEM industry leaders, which Iâm excited to foster. I look forward to finding ways to bring industry partners into the classroom, such as through guest speakers, internships, or collaborative projects. These partnerships will connect classroom learning to real-world careers, showing students how their education applies to the workplace. Exposure to industry professionals has the potential to spark curiosity, motivate exploration of new career paths, and encourage students to see the value in their education.

This externship will help me to better prepare my students for their future careers by making them more aware of the skills they will need and the opportunities that exist in these industries. By sharing my experiences, I can inspire students to be more curious and engaged in their learning, and encourage them to pursue careers in fields they may not have considered otherwise. Overall, I believe this program will allow me to grow as an educator while directly benefiting my students and helping them navigate their future career paths with confidence.
