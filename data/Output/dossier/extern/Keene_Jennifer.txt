INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am currently a middle school science and STEAM teacher at Union School (an innovative alternative school in the Nampa School District). I have experience teaching elementary school students as well. I am part of a team of teachers at Union school that are in the process of creating a STEAM program where a group of our middle and high school students are learning to create and teach STEAM lessons to elementary students in a mentorship-type outreach through a grant from TMCWorks. One of the goals of our STEAM program is to teach our middle and high school STEAM ambassadors job skills and to introduce them to STEAM/STEM careers and interests that they would not otherwise have access to. I'm hoping this externship will help me gain skills and community connections in the field of STEAM/STEM that I can use in the classroom as well as in the development of our STEAM program.

Other interesting experience:
I enjoy working with youth in a creative and fun setting. I spent several summers working at camps as a cabin counselor and craft director for elementary and middle school students. I enjoy the outdoors and aiding children in the discovery of the amazing science and beauty that exists around them in nature. 
Some of my favorite outdoor activities include hiking, exploring geology, paddle boarding, and seeking out hot springs.
I have knowledge and teaching experience in life science, physical science, and Earth Science.
I have also worked as a middle school social studies teacher and have an interest and knowledge of history.
I have participated in TMCWorks STEM Instructor training.
I served as yearbook advisor in both the elementary and middle school setting so am capable of using technology to create publications.
I have served on multiple committees developing elementary science curriculum and have done work aligning elementary and middle school state standards to instruction. 
I co-created and co-ran a middle school program for The Ridge Middle School in the Nampa School District. This small school was working on STEM certification and partnering with Columbia High School's STEM Academy when we were forced to close due to the school district consolidating schools last year.
I have a K-12 master's degree in in reading and literacy. 
I have a good eye for interior design and creative use of spaces, with experience in basic renovations (painting, laying tile, up-cycling furniture, etc.).
