INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I teach World Geography at the middle school level and enjoy engaging students in Hands-On activities. Part of my Intro to Geography units deals with Physical Geography where we talk about the Plate tectonics theory and the results of that process in the cause of earthquakes and volcanoes. I also cover Climate and Vegetation of the World and Biomes. Participating in this externship will allow me to reconfigure how I present Physical Geography unit material to my students. Also I will be able to do some cross curricular activities with the 8th Grade Science teacher as they too go into depth of Earth Science. I look forward to this opportunity.
