INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	*  I teach middle school math and ELA. Historically many of my students who are Nez Perce Tribal members go into fisheries or technical skills careers. I want to give them as many opportunities as possible to experience STEM in many different ways to develop their interests and talents. I want my students to succeed past high school in college or their chosen career and that can be sparked by STEM opporunities.
