INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I believe it is just as important to use STEM in the music classroom (i.e. STEAM) as it is in any of the other subjects.   This externship will allow me to learn and connect students with skills of technology and engineering and how they apply to the arts.  My hope is that it will benefit our students by providing a well-rounded education as well as the opportunity to share careers that involve both the arts and technology.  More and more technology is being involved in music creation and music production, and it would be a disservice to our students if we did not teach this aspect of music.  
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Instrument repair/craftsmanship and music technology (recording, computers, mixing, etc.)
