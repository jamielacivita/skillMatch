INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* After 20 years of teaching high school and countless sessions of professional development, I'm excited to experience the STEM Externship to enhance my curriculum, pedagogy, and inspire students to become "life-long" learners. The externship will expose me to the latest tools and practices in STEM fields, providing me with experience and insight on how to practically revise my curriculum to align with current industry norms. I will also learn how to implement problem-solution and hands-on activities that promote experiential learning and project-based instruction strategies. Students will benefit from these pragmatic and industry-connected activities, becoming more engaged and finding a higher purpose within the classroom. My experience with STEM will equip me to reinforce the importance of learning from real-world experiences and inspire students to explore STEM career paths. Finally, STEM will provide me with an opportunity to expand my network with other educators and professionals, opening doors for further professional development and opportunities.
