INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As a bilingual teacher who is passionate about creating and fostering creativity as well as curiousity in young learners. I am really excited about the potential opportunity to join this externship! I believe it is an incredible opportunity to not only bridge the gap between education and STEM professions but also to provide hands on, real world applications of STEM that I will be able to discuss with my learners. 

For my kindergarten students, engaging in a program like this will help me to integrate foundational STEM concepts into the earliest learning experiences in ways that are fun, accessible, and culturally relevant. I hope to incorporate practical activities that spark curiosity, nurture problem-solving skills, and build confidenceâespecially for multilingual learners who may not initially see themselves represented in STEM fields.  

For my middle school broadcasting students, this program will help me include STEM principles into our projects, such as understanding the technology behind media , sound engineering, and potentially even using coding for digital storytelling. By sharing real-world examples from the externship, I hope to be able to show them how broadcasting correlates with engineering, math, and technology, potentially inspiring them to pursue future opportunities in STEM-related fields.  

Ultimately, I hope this experience will not only deepen my understanding of STEM but also empower me to create innovative, cross-curricular lessons that encourage all my students to see themselves as capable creators, problem solvers, and contributors to the modern world.
