Applicant : Kessler, Heidi
School (district) : Hawthorne Middle School (District 25)
Role(s) : Administrator;
LinkedIn Profile : I have a lot of interests and hobbies outside of the school setting. I am an avid gardener, and my garden produces a LOT of veggies, flowers, and herbs. We have implemented a hydroponics program here at our school. Learners grow vegetables and sell them to the community as a fundraiser.  We also have a school flower garden that students tend to during the fall months. I also have two horses, several dogs, and a flock of egg-laying chickens.  I am interested in environmental issues and protecting our natural resources here in Idaho.  I take special interest in working with the tribal community (Shoshone Bannock tribes), as many of our students are Native American.  My husband and I enjoy hunting and fishing. We also are avid trail runners/hikers, bikers, skiers, snowshoers, campers. I love backpacking and doing all things outside!

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Hawthorne Middle School staff is committed to providing relevant STE(A)M education to our 6th through 8th graders. We want to help our learners become ready for future jobs in Idaho. Our teachers love collaborating with businesses and community organizations so we can make sure our instruction aligns with relevant and current topics and issues within our community and the state. Additionally, Hawthorne's student population is extremely diverse culturally and socioeconomically. We are always looking for ways to make connections for all of our students, even ones from diverse backgrounds. Our teachers are already sharing their expertise with students through after school clubs and we would love to partner with entities outside of the school setting so our learners can see all the opportunities waiting for them once they graduate.
