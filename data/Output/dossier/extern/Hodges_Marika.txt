INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have participated in the Externship program before and have found that it has opened many doors for resources, guest speakers, and educational avenues for my students. After my externship, I was able to implement many lessons referencing back to my experience with the program and even had the students run a simulation project that was similar to the one I worked on. Overall, I believe that the program will benefit students that I serve through opening doors of different ways of thinking and sources of knowledge.

Other interesting experience:
I have several hobbies and interests outside of the educational purview that greatly influence my teaching styles and focus. Specifically, I have interests and experience in the fields of wildlife biology, forestry management, state history, livestock (sheep, chickens, and horses) and agriculture. I have spent many years in the mountains of Idaho helping out at kid's horse camps and trail riding experiences, as well as volunteered as a docent at Zoo Boise, and lived and worked in a rural Alaskan village. All of these experiences have influences my teaching style and my way of thinking about the world and the part we play in it.
