INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a non-traditional teacher in that I came from the workforce and then decided to get into education. Going this route better prepared me for education and has led to a well-rounded teaching approach; I can teach students what they need within the restaurant industry. As a returning Idaho native, I have very few contacts and I believe teaching can be the most impactful if community engagement is present. I want to branch out into our community and expand my resources to better serve my students. Meeting more people can really open up opportunities for internships, job shadowing, or future careers for my students.
