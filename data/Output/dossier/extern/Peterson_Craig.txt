Applicant : Peterson, Craig
School (district) : John Brown Elementary (Lakeland 272)
Role(s) : Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);
LinkedIn Profile : My past externship with Idaho Forest Group in Coeur d'Alene was a fantastic experience for many reasons that I still value and would count toward another match. These experiences included:
getting out into the mountains on logging sites, 
being at the mills where the the technical work happened, 
and being in the office where the training and logistical side of things occurred. 
As for other interests, I love anything science related; be it biology, ballistics, earth science, or physics, and anything in between. 
I am gaining very rudimentary knowledge in fabrication and machining, mostly because my son is currently taking college courses in that field. I would love to learn more. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* My last experience gave me a lot of material I still use in my current teaching practices.  There is a lot of real life experience and knowledge to be learned by working in the private sector.

Obviously, getting a supplement to my salary is also a nice bonus.
