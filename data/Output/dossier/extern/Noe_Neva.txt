Other interesting experience:
I have taken middle school students on three trips to Washington, D.C. and New York City. I have been involved with 4-H for twelve years of my children's lives, helping them work with cattle, sheep, rabbits, as well as prepare for demonstrations and presentations. Recently, I have been working with a middle school age troop and have helped the girls manage earning badges of their choosing. I am in charge of putting together professional development training for my education colleagues during both the school year and during the summer.
