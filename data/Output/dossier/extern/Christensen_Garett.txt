INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As a music teacher, my students are interested in many different areas of life or expertise that they want to pursue.  After reading through some of the blog testimonies, I thought this would provide a good opportunity to learn about other subject areas that my students participate in.  Ag education is a big one for my area.  Branching outside of music is a great way to help support my students as well to understand how to support them better.
