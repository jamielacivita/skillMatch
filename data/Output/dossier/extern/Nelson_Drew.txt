Applicant : Nelson, Drew
School (district) : Idaho School for the Deaf and Blind (Idaho Educational Services for the Deaf and Blind)
Role(s) : High School Teacher;Special Education Teacher;Early Elementary Teacher (K-2nd);Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);Middle School Teacher;I teach High School Health, P.E. K-12, and Special Needs P.E. K-12;
LinkedIn Profile : I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.

	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:

Externship durations they are available for:
Other interesting experience:
I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Life Science / Biology

Externship durations they are available for:
Other interesting experience:
I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Life Science / Biology
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Physics

Instructional work they are open to during externship:

Curriculum design : Yes
Externship durations they are available for:
Other interesting experience:
I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Life Science / Biology
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)

Externship durations they are available for:
Other interesting experience:
I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Life Science / Biology
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Physics

Externship durations they are available for:
Other interesting experience:
I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Life Science / Biology
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)

Externship durations they are available for:
Other interesting experience:
I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am a full-time educator, about to wrap up my first full year of certified teaching. I love this career path and I want more opportunities to develop and grow my skills. I have been "educating" since I worked as a boy scout camp counselor, teaching merit badges as a teenager. 

I believe that this program will provide me with the opportunity to flex my skills in ways that I haven't been able to, and grow in the areas where my skills are lacking. Working at a school for the deaf and blind has given me very unique opportunities and perspectives. Getting an opportunity outside of this small, specialized educational field will help me to grow and develop skills outside of the skillset I am building in the position I have now. 

By developing skills outside of the ones within my comfort zone, I hope to inform future decision making and deepen my understanding of the information I give my students. As a Physical Education & Health teacher, I am always looking for more, deeper applications to answer the ever-common student question of "why do we need to know this?" With an opportunity like this, I will be more informed and can provide deeper insight into practices outside of my current information bubble.

Other interesting experience:
I earned over 1,200 service hours in Port Angeles, WA, volunteering for AmeriCorps Washington, a nonprofit organization. Here, I acted in all sorts of community odd-jobs, such as helping out with the Boys & Girls club and working at the community Ice Skating rink as a ticket-taker. 

Before that, I was in college as a theater major. Of course, I gained a lot of public speaking skills here, but also I honed my skills as a leader and project manager. At ISU I acted as a Stage Manager, helping to facilitate the operation of several different productions. As a Stage Manager, I was a professional liaison for hundreds of staff, faculty, actors and crew, ensuring the smooth running of several productions at Idaho State University. 

The last experience I want to mention is one I have already brought up in this application; my time spent as a Boy Scout Camp Counselor from the ages of 13-18. I put a heavy emphasis on this as a matter of personal pride; I was a role model Eagle Scout. I feel it demonstrates my willingness and ability to lead from an early age. This also exemplifies my eagerness to learn new skills and teach as an educator among peers, friends, and colleagues. Even now, at age 25 and in my professional development, I feel that I still use many of the skills that I gained while being a Boy Scout so long ago.
