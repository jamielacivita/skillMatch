INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an upper elementary principal, I am deeply committed to fostering STEM education as a pathway to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and academic achievement. Our school has embraced STEM opportunities, and we are already witnessing the direct benefits: increased student interest, participation in problem-solving activities, and rising math and science scores. This growth affirms that STEM is not only engaging but transformative for learners. 

Joining the Idaho STEM Action Committee as an extern offers a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding of STEM initiatives at a state level and bring innovative practices back to our school. I am particularly interested in learning about emerging STEM career pathways, hands-on learning strategies, and how to integrate interdisciplinary approaches that build on our studentsâ natural curiosity.

As an educator, this program will equip me with tools to better support my teachers, providing them with resources and professional development to sustain and enhance STEM instruction. For our students, my participation ensures access to a curriculum that prepares them for a rapidly changing world, empowering them to think creatively and solve complex problems. This externship will position our school as a leader in STEM education, helping us maintain momentum and inspire a new generation of learners.
