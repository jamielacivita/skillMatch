INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator, my passion for teaching STEM has only grown over the years. Last year, I had the privilege of attending a class that integrated STEM with literacy, which was incredibly inspiring. This experience motivated me to apply for and secure a grant through INl, allowing me to further enhance my STEM initiatives in the classroom.

Currently, I teach second grade and have several years of experience in preschool education. In both settings, I have found that incorporating STEM daily not only engages my students but also fosters a love for learning. I am particularly drawn to hands-on activities, as they have proven effective for students who typically struggle with traditional learning methods.

By participating in this program, I hope to expand my knowledge of various STEM fields, which will ultimately benefit my students. I am committed to finding new ways to engage every student in my class and across my school, ensuring that each child has the opportunity to thrive.

I truly believe that this program will enhance my teaching practices and enable me to support my students more effectively. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to this wonderful initiative.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator, my passion for teaching STEM has only grown over the years. Last year, I had the privilege of attending a class that integrated STEM with literacy, which was incredibly inspiring. This experience motivated me to apply for and secure a grant through INl, allowing me to further enhance my STEM initiatives in the classroom.

Currently, I teach second grade and have several years of experience in preschool education. In both settings, I have found that incorporating STEM daily not only engages my students but also fosters a love for learning. I am particularly drawn to hands-on activities, as they have proven effective for students who typically struggle with traditional learning methods.

By participating in this program, I hope to expand my knowledge of various STEM fields, which will ultimately benefit my students. I am committed to finding new ways to engage every student in my class and across my school, ensuring that each child has the opportunity to thrive.

I truly believe that this program will enhance my teaching practices and enable me to support my students more effectively. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to this wonderful initiative.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator, my passion for teaching STEM has only grown over the years. Last year, I had the privilege of attending a class that integrated STEM with literacy, which was incredibly inspiring. This experience motivated me to apply for and secure a grant through INl, allowing me to further enhance my STEM initiatives in the classroom.

Currently, I teach second grade and have several years of experience in preschool education. In both settings, I have found that incorporating STEM daily not only engages my students but also fosters a love for learning. I am particularly drawn to hands-on activities, as they have proven effective for students who typically struggle with traditional learning methods.

By participating in this program, I hope to expand my knowledge of various STEM fields, which will ultimately benefit my students. I am committed to finding new ways to engage every student in my class and across my school, ensuring that each child has the opportunity to thrive.

I truly believe that this program will enhance my teaching practices and enable me to support my students more effectively. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to this wonderful initiative.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator, my passion for teaching STEM has only grown over the years. Last year, I had the privilege of attending a class that integrated STEM with literacy, which was incredibly inspiring. This experience motivated me to apply for and secure a grant through INl, allowing me to further enhance my STEM initiatives in the classroom.

Currently, I teach second grade and have several years of experience in preschool education. In both settings, I have found that incorporating STEM daily not only engages my students but also fosters a love for learning. I am particularly drawn to hands-on activities, as they have proven effective for students who typically struggle with traditional learning methods.

By participating in this program, I hope to expand my knowledge of various STEM fields, which will ultimately benefit my students. I am committed to finding new ways to engage every student in my class and across my school, ensuring that each child has the opportunity to thrive.

I truly believe that this program will enhance my teaching practices and enable me to support my students more effectively. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to this wonderful initiative.
