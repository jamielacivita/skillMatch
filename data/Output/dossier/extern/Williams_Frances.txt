Applicant : Williams, Frances
School (district) : Gooding Elementary School (Gooding School District)
Role(s) : Early Elementary Teacher (K-2nd);Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);Specialist - Music / and lead the after school cooking classes too;
LinkedIn Profile : I have volunteered as a youth counselor at Intermountain Christian Camp in Fairfield, ID and many years as a counselor at Round Lake Christian Camp in Lakeville, OH.  I have also volunteered as a youth leader for Jr. High and High School students at Gooding First Christian Church in Gooding, ID for 6 years and for 14 years at Lexington Church of Christ in Lexington, OH.  This involved mentoring a lot of students, mainly females and being a sponsor at events or trips taken.  I have been involved in many mission trips helping build homes not only in the US but in Mexico and the Dominican Republic as well.
I also volunteer my time to Gooding First Christian Church doing graphic design.  I am only self taught, but enjoy dabbling with Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Express, Rush and a few other programs.  I also love photography and editing as well.

I would not call myself completely fluent in Spanish, but speak it well enough that I often translate for Parent Teacher Conferences at our school and any other times it is needed. Family engagement among our migrant workers is also something I am passionate about, so Spanish comes in handy in those areas.
I am also currently the Gooding High School Booster Club President, so that is another avenue where I enjoy being a part of community around me.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As a music educator, I have long believed that the Arts combined with Stem will not only make a student more well rounded, but enhance their cognitive and creative skills as well.  The collaborative skills gained from both the Arts and the Stem field should also benefit students well beyond their school years as they have to work with multiple types of people.  As a lifelong learner, I hope to grasp STEM concepts better to explore how to connect my music field to the STEM field in the classroom.  I believe it will bring even more excitement to the music room and my lessons than is already there.

It would be interesting to see data on how jingles in commercials might influence decisions people make.  One Unit I do with 5th grade is creating a product, figuring out how it would enhance people's lives, and then the student's compose their own music for a commercial and create lyrics and music for a product jingle.  It is always a fun project, but it would fun to get information from an actual company.

I also lead our after school/summer school cooking classes for grades 3-8.  I love creating recipes and teaching our students not only safety skills in the kitchen, but connecting math to food preparation as well.  I would love to learn and then teach marketing skills to what they create as well as more creative ways to involve Math and Science based learning in this program.
