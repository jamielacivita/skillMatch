Applicant : Castronova, Mary
School (district) : Eagle High School (West Ada)
Role(s) : High School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : I enjoyed both of my previous externships because they were the polar opposite of what I learned and the knowledge I gained from each experience. I have volunteered at summer camps and I enjoy traveling and exploring new places. I am good at analyzing text and writing professionally. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:

It will benefit my students because I can return to my job with a new perspective about careers and offer my insights to my students. I teach juniors and seniors and the next steps after high school are at the forefront of some of my class lessons.
