INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* This helps me step out of my comfort zone and see the working world through a different lens. It is a way for me to see a vast array of choices in the workforce, as well as learning something new. It will benefit my students because I can return to my job with a new perspective about careers and offer my insights to my students. I teach juniors and seniors and the next steps after high school are at the forefront of some of my class lessons.
