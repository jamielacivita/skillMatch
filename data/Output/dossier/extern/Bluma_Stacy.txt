INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I participated in an externship with Idaho Business for Education last summer.  The experience rejuvenated my teaching career.  I found that working outside of the school environment helps me to have a broader view of industries in Idaho.  It gives me a chance to meet professionals who care about improving education and value my viewpoint as an experienced educator in local schools.  I can share that knowledge with other educators and students during the school year.
