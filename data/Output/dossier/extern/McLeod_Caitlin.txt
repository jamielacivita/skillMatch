Applicant : McLeod, Caitlin
School (district) : Nezperce Elementary School (Nezperce School District)
Role(s) : Upper Elementary Teacher (3rd+);
LinkedIn Profile : I've been a teacher for 6 years and had some retail experience, daycare experience, and administrative experience. Being 28, I am realizing that I am not very informed on the possibilities of other career pathways. I volunteer for our town's Service League, which completes volunteer projects for our community focused on giving back to others in need and supporting women and children. In this, I lead two big projects, one being our Holiday Donation Drive which collects donations from others to give store gift cards to families who may be struggling during the holiday season. I love the idea of learning about other skills and professions to be able to share with my students. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I think it could definitely benefit my students by giving me different opportunities and ideas that I could apply to my teaching. By giving students purpose and tying learning to real life experiences, I offer more engagement and diverse learning opportunities to best meet the interests of students. It also gives me more opportunities to build relationships with others that I could share with my students, via field trip, guest speakers, guest teachers for lessons, etc. Not to mention the inspiration I could offer for students to explore different career paths.
