Applicant : Stylc, Christina
School (district) : Coeur d' Alene High School (Coeur d' Alene School District #271)
Role(s) : High School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : I have taken various courses through Project Learning Tree which focus on learning about the health of our environment----water, forests, etc.   During the Forestry course our group spend 5 full days exploring rivers, forests, logging operations, sawmills, etc.    I also attended an ASM Materials camp at Montana Tech.    The focus was mostly geared toward the science/chemistry involved in mining, distilling, etc.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I currently teach General Science and Biology to freshman & sophomores who struggle with math and science.   I also teach a basic Chemistry course for juniors and seniors.    Given the increase usage of technology and students who are choosing alternative learning environments (online, employment), I would like to offer more real-world applications to my students.    Students tend to learn better and retain information when they can actually see the value and application to the world around them.
