Applicant : Thomander, Wendy
School (district) : Butte County Middle/High School (Butte County School District)
Role(s) : Middle School Teacher;High School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : Every week, I help lead and teach a group of women in religious and practical education as well as organize volunteer opportunities.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to work with STEM industry professionals and secondary students! As a science teacher, I want to do what I preach and "get out there" with hands on learning and observation. I believe education is vital to my health and the health of my community. To get to share what I learn with my students would be awesome! 

I live in Arco, which is close to INL. I am willing to drive out there daily but not to Idaho Falls. I would especially love to work with the high school internship program. Because I teach at such a small school, I teach a lot of different age groups AND fields of science. So I seem to play the "jack of all trades master of none" educator role but anything biology is my baby!

	* I would love to work with STEM industry professionals and secondary students! As a science teacher, I want to do what I preach and "get out there" with hands on learning and observation. I believe education is vital to my health and the health of my community. To get to share what I learn with my students would be awesome! 

I live in Arco, which is close to INL. I am willing to drive out there daily but not to Idaho Falls. I would especially love to work with the high school internship program. Because I teach at such a small school, I teach a lot of different age groups AND fields of science. So I seem to play the "jack of all trades master of none" educator role but anything biology is my baby!

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to work with STEM industry professionals and secondary students! As a science teacher, I want to do what I preach and "get out there" with hands on learning and observation. I believe education is vital to my health and the health of my community. To get to share what I learn with my students would be awesome! 

I live in Arco, which is close to INL. I am willing to drive out there daily but not to Idaho Falls. I would especially love to work with the high school internship program. Because I teach at such a small school, I teach a lot of different age groups AND fields of science. So I seem to play the "jack of all trades master of none" educator role but anything biology is my baby!

Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to work with STEM industry professionals and secondary students! As a science teacher, I want to do what I preach and "get out there" with hands on learning and observation. I believe education is vital to my health and the health of my community. To get to share what I learn with my students would be awesome! 

I live in Arco, which is close to INL. I am willing to drive out there daily but not to Idaho Falls. I would especially love to work with the high school internship program. Because I teach at such a small school, I teach a lot of different age groups AND fields of science. So I seem to play the "jack of all trades master of none" educator role but anything biology is my baby!

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to work with STEM industry professionals and secondary students! As a science teacher, I want to do what I preach and "get out there" with hands on learning and observation. I believe education is vital to my health and the health of my community. To get to share what I learn with my students would be awesome! 

I live in Arco, which is close to INL. I am willing to drive out there daily but not to Idaho Falls. I would especially love to work with the high school internship program. Because I teach at such a small school, I teach a lot of different age groups AND fields of science. So I seem to play the "jack of all trades master of none" educator role but anything biology is my baby!
