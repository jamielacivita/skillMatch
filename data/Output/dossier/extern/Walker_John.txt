INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Since the new (last year) CTE standards for middle schools were put in place, I have been involved in teaching the CTE classes to our 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students last year and this year.  Getting more hands on experience in a CTE field, I believe, will help me input first hand experience into future lessons with our middle school students.

	* No specific preference - anything goes!
