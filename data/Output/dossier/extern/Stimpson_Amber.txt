Applicant : Stimpson, Amber
School (district) : Gem Prep Online (1426)
Role(s) : Middle School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : I worked for my father's road construction company for 15 years, and still help with MSHA safety training. Wrote the operator's curriculum for the class. I feel strongly about helping students see what options may be a good fit for them and I feel strongly about the 'trades' and growing those fields as well as college careers. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have worked with my father (Gale Lim of Gale Lim Construction) to create an operator's class curriculum in Eastern Idaho. This class allows high school students to see what working in the construction field is like, what skills they need, etc. I helped create 12 weeks of curriculum for the program and I'd like to gather more information if possible to assist not only that program but others in my area as well.
