INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have worked with my father (Gale Lim of Gale Lim Construction) to create an operator's class curriculum in Eastern Idaho. This class allows high school students to see what working in the construction field is like, what skills they need, etc. I helped create 12 weeks of curriculum for the program and I'd like to gather more information if possible to assist not only that program but others in my area as well.
