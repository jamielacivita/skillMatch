INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have been teaching elementary school for 7 years. I am new to middle school science. It is my passion. I would love to learn more techniques on engaging students in STEM. I would also like to deepen my understanding behind the applications of the projects I use in my class. The students I teach are from a rural, low income community, near many mines.

I find that STEM projects give them engaging ways to understand how things work and the possibilities they have for careers in the future.
