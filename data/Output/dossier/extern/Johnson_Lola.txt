INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Professional Statement for Externship Opportunity
I have dedicated 26 years to the field of education, emphasizing that the most valuable lessons I impart to my students extend beyond traditional content. I focus on essential skills such as resilience, persistence, problem-solving, creative and critical thinking, and collaboration. Collaborating with professionals from various fields outside of education has enriched my perspective on the skills students will require and the opportunities that lie ahead of them.
In 2024, I participated in the externship program, which enabled me to bring a wealth of experience back to my classroom. This experience allowed me to design learning tasks aimed at intentionally developing my students' soft skills, ensuring they recognize the importance of these behaviors and dispositions in all areas of life, including school, career, and personal growth.
Throughout my journey, I have shared my experiences of stepping outside my comfort zone to acquire new skills and apply them in innovative waysâopportunities I had not envisioned before the externship. Additionally, I have introduced my art students to STEM career options that they may have previously overlooked, such as graphic and web design, thereby broadening their horizons.
I aspire to continue my professional development through the 2025 Externship program, with the goal of providing my students with even more valuable and meaningful guidance as they prepare for their futures. Thank you for considering my application for this opportunity.
