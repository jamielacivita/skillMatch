Applicant : Risinger, Miranda
School (district) : Reed Elementary (Kuna School District)
Role(s) : Early Elementary Teacher (K-2nd);
LinkedIn Profile : I teach English classes to adult Second Language Learners in a volunteer role.  I have volunteered extensively at a food bank translating and doing intake.  I am a mentor in training for a FIRST robotics team.  I love the outdoors and try to take a couple backpacking trips every summer as well as organize backpacking trips for groups of people.  I have organized 2-5 week summer road trips with food, lodging, activities and transportation for groups of 6-7 people.  I have traveled to several South American countries as well as Spain and Japan. I have bred, delivered, and cared for 3 litters of puppies. I helped my son with an engine rebuild of his 2004 Mini Cooper.  I have engaged in various construction projects around my property building green houses, chicken coops, and playsets.  I have also laid engineered hardwood flooring and tile in my home and the homes of several friends.  I am a volunteer with the Bogus Basin School race teams during January-February each year since 2017.  I also assign and organize the greeting team each week at my church.  

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator of first grade dual language students I feel like there is not much opportunity to engage in science during the regularly scheduled curriculum. I have found that the students are most engaged and excited when I bring up science topics as a part of the reading curriculum.  They all focus in more and their excitement for life and the world around them increases when we see how things work whether is is how a shark breathes, the camouflage of poison dart frogs, or how a chicken lays an egg.  I would like to spark the interest of young learners in fields of science by offering them hands on experiments or experiences whether as a part of their regularly scheduled curriculum or a specials class they visit on a rotation.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator of first grade dual language students I feel like there is not much opportunity to engage in science during the regularly scheduled curriculum. I have found that the students are most engaged and excited when I bring up science topics as a part of the reading curriculum.  They all focus in more and their excitement for life and the world around them increases when we see how things work whether is is how a shark breathes, the camouflage of poison dart frogs, or how a chicken lays an egg.  I would like to spark the interest of young learners in fields of science by offering them hands on experiments or experiences whether as a part of their regularly scheduled curriculum or a specials class they visit on a rotation.     
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Chemistry
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Life Science / Biology

Other interesting experience:
I teach English classes to adult Second Language Learners in a volunteer role.  I have volunteered extensively at a food bank translating and doing intake.  I am a mentor in training for a FIRST robotics team.  I love the outdoors and try to take a couple backpacking trips every summer as well as organize backpacking trips for groups of people.  I have organized 2-5 week summer road trips with food, lodging, activities and transportation for groups of 6-7 people.  I have traveled to several South American countries as well as Spain and Japan. I have bred, delivered, and cared for 3 litters of puppies. I helped my son with an engine rebuild of his 2004 Mini Cooper.  I have engaged in various construction projects around my property building green houses, chicken coops, and playsets.  I have also laid engineered hardwood flooring and tile in my home and the homes of several friends.  I am a volunteer with the Bogus Basin School race teams during January-February each year since 2017.  I also assign and organize the greeting team each week at my church.

I have traveled to several South American countries as well as Spain and Japan. I have bred, delivered, and cared for 3 litters of puppies. I helped my son with an engine rebuild of his 2004 Mini Cooper.  I have engaged in various construction projects around my property building green houses, chicken coops, and playsets.  I have also laid engineered hardwood flooring and tile in my home and the homes of several friends.  I am a volunteer with the Bogus Basin School race teams during January-February each year since 2017.  I also assign and organize the greeting team each week at my church.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator of first grade dual language students I feel like there is not much opportunity to engage in science during the regularly scheduled curriculum. I have found that the students are most engaged and excited when I bring up science topics as a part of the reading curriculum.  They all focus in more and their excitement for life and the world around them increases when we see how things work whether is is how a shark breathes, the camouflage of poison dart frogs, or how a chicken lays an egg.  I would like to spark the interest of young learners in fields of science by offering them hands on experiments or experiences whether as a part of their regularly scheduled curriculum or a specials class they visit on a rotation.     
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Chemistry
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)
	* Earth & Environmental Science

Other interesting experience:
I teach English classes to adult Second Language Learners in a volunteer role.  I have volunteered extensively at a food bank translating and doing intake.  I am a mentor in training for a FIRST robotics team.  I love the outdoors and try to take a couple backpacking trips every summer as well as organize backpacking trips for groups of people.  I have organized 2-5 week summer road trips with food, lodging, activities and transportation for groups of 6-7 people.  I have traveled to several South American countries as well as Spain and Japan. I have bred, delivered, and cared for 3 litters of puppies. I helped my son with an engine rebuild of his 2004 Mini Cooper.  I have engaged in various construction projects around my property building green houses, chicken coops, and playsets.  I have also laid engineered hardwood flooring and tile in my home and the homes of several friends.  I am a volunteer with the Bogus Basin School race teams during January-February each year since 2017.  I also assign and organize the greeting team each week at my church.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator of first grade dual language students I feel like there is not much opportunity to engage in science during the regularly scheduled curriculum. I have found that the students are most engaged and excited when I bring up science topics as a part of the reading curriculum.  They all focus in more and their excitement for life and the world around them increases when we see how things work whether is is how a shark breathes, the camouflage of poison dart frogs, or how a chicken lays an egg.  I would like to spark the interest of young learners in fields of science by offering them hands on experiments or experiences whether as a part of their regularly scheduled curriculum or a specials class they visit on a rotation.     
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Chemistry
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Life Science / Biology

I would like to spark the interest of young learners in fields of science by offering them hands on experiments or experiences whether as a part of their regularly scheduled curriculum or a specials class they visit on a rotation.     
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Chemistry
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources

Other interesting experience:
I teach English classes to adult Second Language Learners in a volunteer role.  I have volunteered extensively at a food bank translating and doing intake.  I am a mentor in training for a FIRST robotics team.  I love the outdoors and try to take a couple backpacking trips every summer as well as organize backpacking trips for groups of people.  I have organized 2-5 week summer road trips with food, lodging, activities and transportation for groups of 6-7 people.  I have traveled to several South American countries as well as Spain and Japan. I have bred, delivered, and cared for 3 litters of puppies. I helped my son with an engine rebuild of his 2004 Mini Cooper.  I have engaged in various construction projects around my property building green houses, chicken coops, and playsets.  I have also laid engineered hardwood flooring and tile in my home and the homes of several friends.  I am a volunteer with the Bogus Basin School race teams during January-February each year since 2017.  I also assign and organize the greeting team each week at my church.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator of first grade dual language students I feel like there is not much opportunity to engage in science during the regularly scheduled curriculum. I have found that the students are most engaged and excited when I bring up science topics as a part of the reading curriculum.  They all focus in more and their excitement for life and the world around them increases when we see how things work whether is is how a shark breathes, the camouflage of poison dart frogs, or how a chicken lays an egg.  I would like to spark the interest of young learners in fields of science by offering them hands on experiments or experiences whether as a part of their regularly scheduled curriculum or a specials class they visit on a rotation.     
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Chemistry
	* Health Professions (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary, etc.)
	* Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.)
	* Earth & Environmental Science
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
	* Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources
	* Life Science / Biology

Other interesting experience:
I teach English classes to adult Second Language Learners in a volunteer role.  I have volunteered extensively at a food bank translating and doing intake.  I am a mentor in training for a FIRST robotics team.  I love the outdoors and try to take a couple backpacking trips every summer as well as organize backpacking trips for groups of people.  I have organized 2-5 week summer road trips with food, lodging, activities and transportation for groups of 6-7 people.  I have traveled to several South American countries as well as Spain and Japan. I have bred, delivered, and cared for 3 litters of puppies. I helped my son with an engine rebuild of his 2004 Mini Cooper.  I have engaged in various construction projects around my property building green houses, chicken coops, and playsets.  I have also laid engineered hardwood flooring and tile in my home and the homes of several friends.  I am a volunteer with the Bogus Basin School race teams during January-February each year since 2017.  I also assign and organize the greeting team each week at my church.
