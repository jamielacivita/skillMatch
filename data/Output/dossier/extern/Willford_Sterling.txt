INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I used to teach STEM, and the INL representative at teacher conferences always emphasized the importance of communication even in STEM careers. I now teach communication courses, and I want to be able to teach firsthand the integral role of communication in STEM fields. This experience would allow me to gear assignments to align more closely with workplace communication skills. In addition, the debate students I teach often are assigned topics dealing with STEM topics ranging from energy production to regulation of cryptocurrency. The more I can expose myself to different STEM industries, the better resource I can be for these students.
STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
	* No specific preference - anything goes!

Other interesting experience:
I worked several summers (and full-time for a while) with the Boy Scouts of America. I trained teams ranging from 14 years old to leaders in their 60's. As a family, we've engaged in many remodeling projects (in my childhood hom, for my siblings, and in my own home), so I have some basic knowledge of electrical circuits, plumbing, and general construction. I would love to expand my knowledge in these areas, but I'm fascinated by most STEM careers. I once participated through I-STEM with a NASA group that was studying the volcanic flows around Craters of the Moon; it was absolutely fascinating for me to learn from them.
