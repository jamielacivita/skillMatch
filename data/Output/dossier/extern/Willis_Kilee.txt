INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As an educator, my passion lies in empowering students to think critically, solve problems, and develop a lifelong love of learning. Being part of a STEM program will allow me to engage in a dynamic, interdisciplinary approach to teaching that fosters these very skills. I am deeply interested in integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics into my teaching practice to create an enriched learning environment. 

A STEM program will equip me with new tools, techniques, and strategies to teach these subjects more effectively. It will help me stay current with technological advancements and scientific discoveries, which I can then share with students to keep them motivated and informed. 

Students benefit most when they are actively engaged in the learning process. STEM encourages inquiry, exploration, and experimentation, helping students see the real-world applications of what they are learning. This fosters curiosity, collaboration, and creativity.
