INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am excited about the opportunity to participate in this STEM internship because I believe it will enhance my ability to integrate STEM principles into my middle school English Language Arts (ELA) classroom. As an educator, I am always striving to offer my students a dynamic and interdisciplinary learning experience that reflects the real-world connections between subjects. By participating in this program, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of STEM concepts and how they can be seamlessly woven into ELA lessons. 

I believe that integrating STEM into my ELA classroom will help foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration among studentsâskills that are essential for success in the 21st century. For example, I could incorporate STEM-focused texts, like engineering case studies or science fiction, into literature discussions or have students engage in project-based learning that ties in both language arts and STEM topics. This would encourage creativity, improve analytical skills, and make learning more relevant to studentsâ lives.

Additionally, I hope that through this internship, I can gain the tools and knowledge to better engage students who may not traditionally see the connection between language arts and STEM fields. By integrating these subjects, I can demonstrate to my students that writing, reading, and communication are essential skills in all areas of learning and in nearly every career, including those in the sciences and technology.

Ultimately, I aim to empower my students to be more confident and curious learners who approach problems from multiple perspectives. I am confident that this internship will not only enrich my own teaching practice but also inspire my students to pursue STEM opportunities with creativity and enthusiasm.
