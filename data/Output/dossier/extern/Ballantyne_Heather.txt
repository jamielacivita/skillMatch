INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am eager to learn about the STEM opportunities our local communities offer our students. I work at a high school with limited access to STEM opportunities. All of our students have the 'at-risk' qualifiers that allow them to attend our school. Having the opportunity to immerse myself and become acquainted with Idaho STEM AC & WDC and their collaborations will provide me with great first-hand accounts I can pass on to our amazing students. So many students, especially the demographics I work with have limited vision for their untapped potential.

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
