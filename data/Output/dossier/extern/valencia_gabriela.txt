INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:

I am a strong believer in developing skills that kids will be able to use on a daily basis. As an educator, I wish I had more time and resources to teach my students critical thinking skills and problem solving skills in a way that kids find it meaningful. By being prt of this program I hope to learn how to incorporate these skills in a fun, meaningful and interactive way. My students would also learn to work together and would develop teamwork skills.

I want to help ELL students develop these valuable skills and use their language skills to make connections in science and engineering.
