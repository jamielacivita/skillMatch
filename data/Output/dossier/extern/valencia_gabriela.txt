As an educator, I wish I had more time and resources to teach my students critical thinking skills and problem solving skills in a way that kids find it meaningful. By being prt of this program I hope to learn how to incorporate these skills in a fun, meaningful and interactive way. My students would also learn to work together and would develop teamwork skills.
