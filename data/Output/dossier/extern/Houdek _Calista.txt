Im passionate about global learning and building connections with teens in and out of the classroom. Recently, I completed my masters thesis in public history, focusing on womens fashion and how it reflects societal change. This project deepened my love for storytelling and bringing history to life.

Ive also enjoyed volunteering on international service projects, like connecting Idaho students with Mozambique peers to support community needs. Outside of teaching, I love being outdoorshiking, exploring forests, and finding ways to connect people with the natural world.
