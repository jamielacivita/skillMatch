Applicant : Harris, Amanda
School (district) : Middleton Middle School (Middleton School District)
Role(s) : Middle School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : I am a local 4-H volunteer focused mainly on market goats. I love teaching hands-on opportunities and have been able to provide that opportunity for many students through coaching teams, teaching summer camps, and workshops teaching how to code, build and fly drones, robotics, 3d printing, Adobe Illustrator, engineering, and design thinking. I enjoy being outside working with our animals or garden. I have written curriculum and been in software testing roles outside of my teaching duties. For my free time outside of all education I enjoy rock hounding and exploring around Idaho.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have had a variety of STEM teaching positions in my education career but have recently settled into a largely focused computer science, digital citizenship, cybersecurity, cryptography, and engineering design teaching role for middle school students. I am hoping that I can match with an organization that could help me prepare my students for future careers and pathways by bringing in what I do for the organization into our classroom to prepare my students. My students love taking my elective courses and I want to continue making them relevant for our students futures. One of my weakest areas is Networks & Communication or Information & Technology but I am a quick learner and extremely organized and productive so this could be a great fit for me.
