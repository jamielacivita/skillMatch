INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I think this program is extremely important to help me prepare my students for future careers in STEM. Since I didn't have as many STEM options as I was growing up and I went into the field of Education, I find that I need to grow more as an educator to better support my students. Whether it's me gaining knowledge about different fields or teaching kids about STEM, it will help me grow my knowledge and guide my students more effectively. 

I currently am working on a team for my district to bring Computer Science opportunities to all of our students at the elementary level and I believe it's important for me to be knowledgeable in different options that are open to my students in the future. I also run an after school STEAM Team so this will provide me with further experience and ideas on what to teach the students who participate in this club. I will be able to build connections with the host to bring opportunities to my classroom and to share the skills I gain with the staff at my school. 

I am always looking for areas that I can grow as an educator and I am very excited about this opportunity to learn more about a field I am passionate about teaching.
