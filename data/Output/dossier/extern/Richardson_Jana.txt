INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have always been interested in STEM and taught STEAM to my fourth graders at Moscow Charter School. I didn't have much training and learned through others or on my own by searching the internet. Using science, technology, engineering, art, and math benefits all students and gets them ready to be productive members of their communities. Teaching STEAM is more engaging and provides opportunities for students to problem solve, make mistakes, and learn perseverance. I would like to provide more STEAM activities in my elementary classroom to reach all learners and make it more fun.

	* No specific preference - anything goes!
