Running a daycare has taught me leadership, organization, and problem-solving, as well as the ability to foster a nurturing environment where children can explore and learn. My passion for technology drives me to stay informed on emerging trends, and I am eager to apply these advancements in early learning environments. This externship would allow me to connect my interest in technology with my experience in child development, enhancing STEM learning for young students.
