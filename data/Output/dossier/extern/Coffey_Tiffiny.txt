INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* My experience last summer reminded me how important it is to connect to the experiences of my students in order to make learning meaningful for them. Even though it was not a specifically STEM related experience, it was immensely valuable for me as a teacher. I would love another opportunity to see how the STEM I am doing with my students can be connected to real world experiences.
