INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I want to be a part of this program because I am passionate about supporting middle school students during a pivotal time in their development. Studies show that middle school is when students begin to explore their identities, interests, and potential career paths. By participating in this program, I hope to gain valuable tools and strategies to help guide students as they start thinking critically about their futures.

For myself as an educator, this program would provide opportunities for professional growth, allowing me to better inspire and engage my students. I want to equip them with the confidence and resources to set meaningful goals and see the connection between their current education and future possibilities.

For the students I serve, I hope to create a supportive and empowering environment where they can explore their strengths, discover their passions, and start building a vision for their futures. By fostering this mindset early, I aim to help students develop the skills and motivation they need to achieve their dreams. This program would allow me to make a lasting impact during a crucial stage of their lives.
