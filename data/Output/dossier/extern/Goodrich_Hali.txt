LinkedIn Profile : I spent 3 years as a board member for Go Lead Idaho, a local nonprofit that focuses on women in leadership positions, business, and the corporate world. I have spent the last 4 years as the Programs Coordinator for Wild Hearts Idaho, another local nonprofit that breaks down barriers for teens to get outside and adventure. As the Programs Coordinator, I gained experience with volunteer recruitment and organization, and communication with board members, mentors, and families. I planned and organized large and small-scale projects to meet organization goals, networked with community partners, and built risk management plans to be carried out for all adventures. 

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have a Master's degree in environmental education paired with a Bachelor's degree in English and Spanish education, and in the public school classroom, it is hard to find a pairing to combine all of my loves. This program would be a way to engage different facets of my professional interests that are not fostered on a regular basis. I am passionate about the community and have really enjoyed using the skills that I have from being an educator to give back to Idaho at large.

Other interesting experience:
I spent 3 years as a board member for Go Lead Idaho, a local nonprofit that focuses on women in leadership positions, business, and the corporate world. I have spent the last 4 years as the Programs Coordinator for Wild Hearts Idaho, another local nonprofit that breaks down barriers for teens to get outside and adventure. As the Programs Coordinator, I gained experience with volunteer recruitment and organization, and communication with board members, mentors, and families. I planned and organized large and small-scale projects to meet organization goals, networked with community partners, and built risk management plans to be carried out for all adventures.

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I have a Master's degree in environmental education paired with a Bachelor's degree in English and Spanish education, and in the public school classroom, it is hard to find a pairing to combine all of my loves.
