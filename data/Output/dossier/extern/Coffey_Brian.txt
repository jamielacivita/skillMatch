INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I learned so much about how AI is being used in the nonprofit sector in Idaho and our region that really opened my eyes and has helped me inform my students about what it's really like out in the workforce now (instead of back when I was in the private workforce before I became a teacher). Students always want to know how they can apply what we're learning in school to their future lives, and now I am more able to give them current, accurate answers because of my experience as an Extern last year.
