INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Participating in this program would help me better understand how to prepare the students I work with for their future after high school and all the available options that might interest them. I've been working individually with a high school student in special education who has an interest in the functionality of objects and putting them together. At the end of this program, I hope to be able to not only help him but other SPED students as well.
