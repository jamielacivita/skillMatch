INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I would love to broaden my horizons to more STEM-focused fields. As primarily an ELA and SpEd teacher, I recognize that while many students rely on language in their day-to-day life (reading and writing are integral parts of most/all aspects of life even post-education), I find that many of their passions and interests lie in hands-on opportunities and most students plan to pursue STEM-based careers. I would love to be able to participate in this program and share my knowledge with them, not only in order to relate to their passions, but also to incorporate these aspects into my lesson planning and in student-facing curriculum. I have been working on giving various "jobs" to my students within the classroom to help mirror the jobs they have expressed interest in, but I would also really like to learn more about the workforce related to STEM so that I'm not just relying on outside research and theory, without having put in the work or gaining firsthand experience for myself. I think both I and my students would be better for it.
