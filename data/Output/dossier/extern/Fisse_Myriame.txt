INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* Integrating a versatile STEM curriculum in the library will benefit me as an educator by providing resources to support differentiated instruction, fostering collaboration with colleagues, and helping students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. For students, it creates opportunities to build future-ready skills, inspires curiosity, and promotes equity by giving all learners access to engaging, hands-on experiences. It will challenge GATE students while supporting traditional learners, allowing both groups to collaborate, grow, and explore their potential in meaningful ways.  I learned so much last summer and want to have an innovative classroom.
