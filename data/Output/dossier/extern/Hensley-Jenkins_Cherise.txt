Applicant : Hensley-Jenkins, Cherise
School (district) : Post Falls High School  (Post Falls )
Role(s) : High School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : In addition to a Masters in English, I also have a B.A. in Marketing and certifications in Copyediting and Paralegal. I have worked in book publishing, where I edited manuscripts, ran a successful blog, and helped organize book launches. While studying marketing, I helped write a business plan for a local bakery and a complete branding plan for a fictional company. Currently, I am the academic advisor for Key Club, which is an organization devoted to community service. Our club has organized food, hygiene, clothing, and blood drives in the Post Falls community. We have also completed a variety of other volunteer work in the area like street cleanup, helping run multiple holiday events, fundraising for the humane society, and other opportunities that help make a difference. In my free time, I enjoy attending book clubs, traveling by cruise, and completing puzzles. My two recent spare-time projects are learning to watercolor paint and play piano; they are still works in progress!  

INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I want to be a part of this program for a variety of reasons. Firstly, I feel like I am a great fit regarding the programs intentions. I consider myself a life-long learner and always have been. As an educator, I take advantage of any PD opportunities available and currently have more than 30 credits accumulated.  I also have multiple degrees and certifications: English, Marketing, Copyediting, and Advanced Paralegal, to name a few. I believe I can be an asset to the company that chooses me and look forward to learning something new and even potentially continuing the relationship after the externship is complete. Secondly, as an educator, I never want to get stagnant, so I am always trying to keep my mind active and engaged; for example, I read more than 100 books per year to stay sharp and expand my knowledge. Despite being in the education field for over ten years now, I do not want to get too comfortable and forget about the other aspects of the world. I feel that this dedication to growth is something I would like to exemplify for my students, which leads me to my third reason. Thirdly, I want to help my students see the many opportunities available to them after they leave public schooling. I teach a variety of students of all abilities, from honors to those in special education,  and I believe everyone needs to know that he/she can make a difference in the world. There are opportunities for all students, and they must realize that high school is not the end of their education. They can go out and change the world, be productive members of society, and even ignite a passion for their career they never knew existed.
