INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I teach 5th grade Dual Language (English & Spanish), and have many students who are not exposed to STEM conversations, activities, field trips, etc at home. I would love to provide them opportunities in the classroom to more exposure to everything/anything STEM, hopefully to consider a career in STEM using their bilingualism. We also have a career exploration unit we cover in April that goes along with an applying for college simulation we do in class, so doing an externship would give me more knowledge to encourage students to pursue STEM careers in their research project.
