School (district) : Wood River High School (Blaine County School District)

LinkedIn Profile : While I dedicate a significant portion of my time to my role as a CTE Teacher and WBL Coordinator, I also enjoy participating in a variety of extracurricular activities and personal pursuits that enrich my life outside the classroom. In addition to my professional responsibilities, I serve as the Student Council Advisor, Yearbook Advisor, and CTE Coordinator, roles that allow me to work closely with students beyond the traditional curriculum. I also manage the bookkeeping for my husbands business, which has honed my organizational and financial skills.

In terms of personal interests, I highly value my time for rest and relaxation. I enjoy outdoor activities such as camping and snowmobiling, which help me unwind and recharge. These experiences allow me to appreciate the importance of balance and self-care, which I strive to model for my students. My involvement in both professional and personal activities helps me stay energized and maintain a well-rounded perspective that I can bring back into my work with students.
