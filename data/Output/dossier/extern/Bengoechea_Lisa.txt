Applicant : Bengoechea, Lisa
School (district) : Jefferson Middle School (Caldwell School District)
Role(s) : Middle School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : I am a life long learner who believes in participating in new things to broaden my viewpoint on various subjects. I love the outdoors and enjoy many activities such as gardening, hiking, camping, hunting, fishing, kayaking/SUP (on calm waters), bike riding and rock hounding...basically anything to get me outside while on summer break.
I am a very good cook/baker. I enjoy knitting and reading during the cooler months. I have no problem speaking with others and enjoy learning about people, their life experiences enthrall me.
I am a farmer with no land. I believe wholeheartedly about eating real foods. A bucket list goal is to grow fresh vegetables and fruits to those who can't afford them, regardless of where they live. Basically establishing a fresh food pantry on wheels is a life long dream of mine.
I love everything to do with hunting and fishing! I have spent the last 10 years hunting the mountains of Idaho. I am an archery hunter and have such wonderful memories with my husband and son. Hiking to remote areas and seeing land and animals/fish that not many people get to see without some effort is incredible to me. Using a drone to capture views in mountainous terrain is so much fun! Spending the night in the open and hearing bugle calls or the cry of a wolf is indescribable. I will never forget my fishing trip to Riggins with my husband, our first attempt at salmon fishing was hilarious!
I am a positive asset to most teams. I come prepared and willing to learn. I put my best effort into anything that I do as long as I am respected and given the opportunity to do so. I can be micromanaged, but prefer to manage myself. I follow directions and can be trusted in all situations. I have worked with confidential materials for 16 years and have never had an issue. I am honest and know my limitations, I will let you know if I cannot do something because I have never done it or I am not physically able to do it.
Thank you for your consideration!! Lisa Bengoechea
