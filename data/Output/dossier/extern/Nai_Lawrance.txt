Role(s) : High School Teacher;
LinkedIn Profile : : For several years, I've been involved in community leadership roles, including a position as the chair of a local youth sports organization. In this role, I managed a team of coaches, organized events, and led initiatives to increase community engagement. This experience has honed my ability to motivate diverse groups and manage complex projects under pressure, skills I believe are directly transferable to leading educational projects outside the traditional classroom setting.
I've also worked in project management for a small educational consulting company, where I was responsible for overseeing the development of a new software tool from conception to launch. This role involved coordinating with cross-functional teams, managing timelines, and ensuring project deliverables met quality standards. My experience here has equipped me with the skills to manage educational projects or camp activities that require meticulous planning and execution.
Beyond my work as an educator, I've engaged in independent research projects focused on self-development and youth, which included fieldwork and data analysis. This experience not only sharpened my research skills but also my ability to translate complex information into accessible knowledge, useful for creating educational content or leading informative sessions at camps or externships.
I have directed multiple summer camps, both in educational and recreational contexts. One notable experience was running a STEM-focused camp where I developed and oversaw a curriculum that integrated outdoor activities with science education. This role involved managing logistics, staff training, and program development, ensuring that every aspect of the camp was both educational and engaging.

Why do you want to be a part of this program?

I am looking forward to joining the Idaho STEM Action Center's externship program because it represents a unique opportunity to enhance my teaching methodologies with real-world STEM applications. I participated in this program in the past and I had a great experience. I was able to learn a tremendous amount from my relationship with Micron in building lessons and courses for both JH and HS science classes.  As an educator at Shoshone Bannock JH/HS, I am committed to fostering a diverse and active learning environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their educational journey. This program offers a chance for me to gain practical experience by engaging directly with STEM professionals, I can better understand industry needs and trends, which will allow me to tailor my curriculum to be more relevant and engaging. This experience will help me develop hands-on, project-based learning opportunities that resonate with students' interests and future career paths.
The externship will expose me to cutting-edge educational practices and technologies. This exposure will enable me to bring innovative teaching techniques into the classroom, making STEM subjects more accessible and exciting for students, particularly in areas where there might be a decline in interest, such as reading among younger students as a foundation for STEM literacy.

This program promises to expand my professional network, providing mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other educators and industry experts. This aspect will not only refine my teaching skills but also keep me updated with the latest educational research and practices.

The insights and experiences from this externship will empower me to design curricula that are not only aligned with state standards but also with real-world applications, thereby increasing student engagement and understanding.
I anticipate gaining new strategies for classroom management and student motivation, particularly in STEM fields, which can be challenging to teach in an engaging manner.
Working alongside professionals in STEM will boost my confidence in teaching these subjects, knowing I am preparing students with skills that are directly applicable in the workforce

My students will see the direct connection between what they learn in class and real-world scenarios, which can motivate them to pursue STEM fields more seriously. By bringing fresh, industry-informed perspectives into the classroom, I can help rekindle interest in STEM, especially among students who might feel disconnected from traditional teaching methods. The externship will allow me to introduce career exploration into my teaching, helping students to envision their future in STEM careers, thereby providing them with a clearer path and motivation for their educational journey.


This externship will not only enrich my teaching practices but also significantly enhance the educational experience and career readiness of the students I serve.
