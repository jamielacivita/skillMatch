Applicant : Lawrence, Jennifer
School (district) : Bridgewater Elementary (Bonneville Joint District 93)

LinkedIn Profile : I have experience in behavioral intervention. I have worked with families to develop plans for behavioral interventions and worked with professionals to implement those plans. I have also worked directly with children implementing interventions. I am interested in geology and spend some recreational time learning about local geological features. I also enjoy learning about animals and their contributions to our world. 

INTERESTS
