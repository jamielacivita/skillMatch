ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* IRC Intensive Case Management Housing Extern		

Objectives
	* Support recently arrived refugees to address social, economic, and cultural challenges they face directly relating to housing.		


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Conduct home visits with clients enrolled in Intensive Case Management programs, identify clients who need assistance with housing related issues, submit low-income housing applications, brainstorm with caseworkers to come up with sustainable solutions for clients facing housing issues.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Clients enrolled in Intensive Case Management (ICM) are individuals who were resettled as refugees within the past 5 years and face additional challenges to settling in, such as physical or mental disabilities, medical issues, legal issues, financial hardship, etc. Working with the IRC's ICM Housing Team will provide STEM externs the chance to work directly with ICM clients facing housing issues in a social work context.  Our clients have been previously displaced from their home country, so externs will get the opportunity to work with a diverse range of clients from many countries and linquistic backgrounds. There will also be ample opportunities for externs to engage with the data capture side of our work. 	


Network growth:
	* The ICM team focuses supporting and empowering clients to reach their self-identified goals and achieve self-sufficiency.  The extern will have the opportunity to work alongside members of the Intensive Case Management team, which is comprised of social workers, counselors, caseworkers, and former refugees. 	


Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;
