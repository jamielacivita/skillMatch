ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
Melaleuca: The Wellness Company is a consumer packaged goods company that manufactures and distributes more than 400 health and wellness products. The products are shipped directly to two million households each year.

Melaleuca manufactures and distributes supplements and nutritional products, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, cosmetics, laundry and home cleaning products, and other wellness products of superior quality. Melaleuca customers purchase Melaleuca products online from the companyâs website. This convenient system changes the way hundreds of thousands of customers shop by eliminating middlemen and reducing marketing and distribution costs. This enables the company to spend more on research and development and high-quality, environmentally friendly ingredients while maintaining reasonable prices. 

Melaleuca was founded in 1985 by Frank VanderSloot, who served as CEO for 37 years and now oversees the company as Executive Chairman. Though Melaleuca began as a small operation with a handful of products and employees, the company has steadily grown since its founding nearly four decades ago. Melaleucaâs headquarters are still located in Idaho Falls, Idaho, where the company began.

It became an international company in the early 1990s when Melaleuca products entered the Canadian market, and Melaleuca now operates in over 20 countries and territories. Melaleuca generates over $2 billion in annual revenue. 

Melaleuca was a Forbes Best Employer in America four years in a row. The company was also named one of Forbesâ Best Employers for Women. Other awards the company has received include the Idaho Business Reviewâs Empowering Women Award, the Salvation Armyâs Others Award, and the Alturas Instituteâs Susan B. Anthony Award.
