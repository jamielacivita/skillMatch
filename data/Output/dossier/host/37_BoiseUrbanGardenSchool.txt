ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* BUGS Summer Camps Environmental and Garden Education Planning and Delivery 

Objectives
	* Boise Urban Garden School runs 5-day a week summer camps with STEM themes, providing a rich learning experience for our campers focusing on topics such as gardening, soil health, sustainability, insects and pollinators, garden to table culinary skills, harvesting and tasting, health and nutrition.  BUGS would benefit from having an extern help with planning camps and enrichment activities, as well as supporting and/or leading camp activities along with our other employees.  We strive to provide the highest quality hands-on educational experience for our campers and having qualified externs through this program would help support that mission.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The extern would help plan STEM based camp themes and activities to create the most meaningful experience for our campers.  The extern would coordinate necessary supplies, create materials, communicate with the other camp leads and supports, interact with campers and parents, and lead camps and activities.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This opportunity would immerse the extern in the areas of gardening, soil health, sustainability, culinary skills, and nutrition and health.

Network growth:
	* The extern would interact and collaborate regularly one on one and through group meetings with our professional farmer, our registered dietitian, environmental educators, culinary instructors as well as opportunities for STEM guests and field trips.

Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;
