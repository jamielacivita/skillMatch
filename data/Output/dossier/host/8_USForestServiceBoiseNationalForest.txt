ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Boise National Forest Engineering â Multiple Projects 

Objectives
	* Working with our engineering team for upcoming summer 2025 projects and supporting recreation and timber programs on the Boise National Forest.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* May include, but not limited to, assisting with construction administration on public works projects, trail bridges, campgrounds and facilities, surveying, data collection, and assisting with forest sign coordination program.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This project will expose the educator to tools, processes and technical terminology associated with STEM jobs, particularly as related to civil engineering. Exposure to the inner workings of engineering -- how software interacts with construction and how plans and contract packages are developed will give educators more confidence incorporating more advanced technologies with their students. 

Network growth:
	* Extern will meet and interact with a variety of specialists within the Boise National Forest, to include fish biologists, botanists, archeologists, recreation specialists, and the timber management team. May also have opportunities to meet with construction contractors, and other federal agencies. 

Skills desired:
	* Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Email & Administrative Software;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* Earth & Environmental Science;Math;Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.);Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources;Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.);
