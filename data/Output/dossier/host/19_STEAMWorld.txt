ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
STEAM World develops and delivers STEM/STEAM programs to underserved rural schools across Idaho and Montana

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Summer STEM Program

Objectives
	* STEAM World will gain the needed assistance in delivering additional summer STEM programs to rural schools in Idaho & Montana

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The Extern will spend time becoming familiar with the broad STEM/STEAM products and activities available. Time will also be spent designing curriculum for different age groups. Contacting schools to arrange for at school programs and delivering the programs. Myself and the Staff at STEAM World and Computer Zen will assist in the above activities

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* One of our favorite STEM activities involves capturing the nerve signals when a student opens and closes their hand. We then allow the student to see and hear the electrical activity from those nerves firing. We go further amplifying this signal and sending it to a computer servo motor connected to a pair of pliers. You can imagine the excitement as a student is now controlling a pair of pliers using their mind. We then get in to  a conversation of how this could be used in real life and eventually some one mentions prosthetic limbs. We then show a video from the University of Florida were they 3D print prosthetic limbs for children and use the identical technology so the child can control the limb.

Network growth:
	* They will actively be working with the staff from STEAM World and also the staff from Computer Zen seeing and experiencing STEM in action (Computers, networking, security cameras, fiber optics, VOIP/SIP phone systems, PA/Bells, etc...

Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;
