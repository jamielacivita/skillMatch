ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* STEM Scholars

Objectives
	* The desired business outcomes of the STEM Scholars program, which includes the use of the teacher externs, are developing a talent pipeline, enhancing community engagement, and promoting STEM advocacy. Idaho National Laboratory benefits by inspiring potential future employees, improving its public image, and fostering partnerships with educational institutions. Teacher externs help bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world applications, enriching both student and teacher experiences. This strengthens the lab's reputation as a leader in STEM education and contributes to workforce development. Additionally, the program supports social responsibility by investing in youth and educator development, aligning with the lab's mission to advance science and technology through community involvement.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Week one: Attend an orientation session to understand the program's goals, schedule, and safety protocols.
Afternoon: Meet with Idaho National Laboratory staff and other educators to discuss collaborative teaching strategies and program expectations.
Task: Prepare for the week's activities by reviewing materials and setting up classroom spaces.

Week two thru six: Hands-on Learning and Experimentation
Guide students through hands-on experiments and activities in laboratory settings, ensuring they understand the scientific principles involved.
Facilitate group discussions and reflections on the day's experiments, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Task: Monitor student progress and provide individualized support as needed.

Field Trips and Real-world Applications
 Accompany students on field trips to various lab facilities, introducing them to real-world applications of STEM concepts.
 Lead debriefing sessions to help students connect their field trip experiences to classroom learning.
Task: Collaborate with lab staff to organize and oversee field trip logistics.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This experience will help them understand the relevance of STEM in various industries and inspire them to incorporate real-world applications into their teaching. Additionally, externs will have the opportunity to collaborate with INL professionals, gaining insights into different STEM careers and the skills required, which they can share with their students to better prepare them for future opportunities in STEM fields.

Network growth:
	* We will set up tours and such for them. 

Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;Public Speaking / Group Presentation

STEM domain experience desired:
	* Math;Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.);Information & Communication Technology (e.g. networking, data management, building/troubleshooting computer systems, etc.)
