Overview

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* TRIO Upward Bound: Educational Workshop Facilitator (Survey of STEM Careers and Multimedia)

Objectives
	* We would like to see our typically underrepresented high school students (low-income and first-generation) learn about possible STEM careers through planned curriculum and workshops (guest speakers, field trips, engaging projects and hands-one activities). We would also like our students to learn the basics of Multimedia technology and create a summer electronic Memory book that could be shared with all students and staff participating in the 2025 TRIO Upward Bound summer program. In addition, students would learn the basics of VR and careers associated with this developing technology.

Our organization would benefit from this externship is so many ways. First, our students would be exposed to innovative STEM activities and careers, which goes directly toward our objective of students going on and participating in post-secondary education/training after high school. It would also would help our organization financially, because we would save us money in personnel. The funds saved here would go directly back to the students and help provide additional engaging educational/cultural/social activities for our 2025 BSU TRIO Upward Bound program. 

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The extern will:
- Attend an 8 hour TRIO Upward Bound summer program training on June 6, 2025
- Complete background check, Minors on Campus training, and University van certification  
- Create curriculum for two high school Technology courses: 1.) Survey of STEM Careers and 2.) Multimedia Technology
- Have access to 11 passenger vans that can be used for STEM field trips
- Have access to various technology including iPads, laptops, Raspberry Pi's, VR equipment w/educational subscription, educational science kits, robots (used to teach the basics of coding), 3D Printers, etc.
- Have access to Boise State University STEM equipment and opportunities (including labs on campus, Albertson's library, etc.)
- Research and network with local STEM organizations and create partnerships for future work with TRIO (including but not limited to career field trip opportunities, student summer internships, youth events, STEM grants, equipment donations, guest speaker engagements, etc.)  
- Teach two 3.5 hour Technology classes to roughly 6-10 TRIO Upward Bound students each day
- Plan and facilitate STEM lesson plans and field trips
- Create an electronic TRIO Upward Bound summer program memory book for students and staff
- Assist with photos/filming/editing of organization events 
- Attend academic staff meetings weekly

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This project will place externs in a role that is hands-on and encourages cross-disciplinary exposure. Specifically, externs will engage in industry site visits, use a variety of innovative educational technology, and learn to better work with underrepresented youth populations. Externs will work network directly with STEM organizations. They will gain information about the field and experience mentorship through insights into the diverse use of STEM in the area. Lastly, externs will help students bridge the gap between classroom learning and practical STEM applications in the workplace.

What types of learning will externs get from this work?
	* Extern will get exposed to a specific STEM field;Project will connect what is taught in schools to real world STEM careers;Extern will acquire a new STEM skill;Extern will learn what STEM employers want in future STEM employees - hard and soft skills;work with underrepresented youth;Extern will learn how a STEM organization works;

Network growth:
	* Previously answered.

Externs will research and facilitate student field trips to a variety of STEM careers in the community as well as Boise State University departments who are facilitating lab research.
