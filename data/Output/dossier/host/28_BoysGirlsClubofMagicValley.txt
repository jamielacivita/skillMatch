ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
We are a youth development organization serving kids ages 5-18. We provide an affordable, safe space for kids to be after school and during the summer when school is not in session. We provide caring mentors and high-quality programs in the areas of Sports, Fitness & Recreation, The Arts, Character & Leadership, Health & Life Skills, Workforce/Career Development, and of course - STEM! We have 10 Club sites across the Magic Valley in the communities of Twin Falls, Jerome, Buhl, and Rupert serving over 4,000 youth each year. STEM programming is a huge part of what we do, and connecting our programs to real-world experiences is extremely important to us. We try to expose our Club members to different career opportunities and give them opportunities that they might not otherwise have due to a variety of different barriers. We try to take advantage of any opportunity to enhance and expand our programs to ensure we are giving all of our Club members and optimal Club experience. 

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* TMC for Teens & Tweens

Objectives
	* By using our mobile stem trailer (TMC) to facilitate hands-on, immersive STEM experiences for our teens & tweens, we will:
â¢	Cultivate a generation that is excited and engaged with STEM topics from an early age.
â¢	Increase STEM engagement and awareness for our teen and tweens.
â¢	The externs will gain real-world experience in STEM programming and enhance their skills in teaching STEM concepts.  
â¢	Externs will gain valuable experience in facilitating hands-on STEM education and leadership, boosting their confidence and teaching expertise. 
â¢	Youth will develop critical STEM skills such as problem-solving, collaboration, creativity, and technical proficiency, which will prepare them for future academic and career opportunities. 

Our organization will benefit from this because it will:
â¢	Enhance and expand the range of STEM related activities we can offer
â¢	Improve our collaboration with educators 
â¢	Contribute to the broader goal of preparing youth for successful futures in an increasingly STEM-driven world
â¢	Potential for long-term collaborations with externs who have a positive experience 


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The project involves utilizing the Think Make Create Lab, a mobile STEM trailer, to engage teens & tweens in hands-on STEM learning experiences while providing an extern with real-world experience in STEM programming. The extern will lead and facilitate activities in the mobile lab that focus on topics such as coding, robotics, engineering, and design. The goal is to offer an interactive learning environment for the youth while exposing the extern to various career paths and practical applications of STEM skills. The mobile lab will bring STEM learning directly to the youth, allowing them to work on creative, problem-solving activities in an engaging and dynamic way. Weâd like the extern to do STEM programming 1-hour each day during our 9-week summer program. At the end of the summer, weâd like to coordinate a field trip to Micron to learn more about STEM careers.

Day-to-day tasks will include: 
â¢	Preparation and set up â Prepare the TMC trailer for the dayâs activities. Ensure all materials are organized and ready to go. Conduct a quick safety check to ensure everything is in working order.
â¢	Facilitate STEM workshops for Teens & Tweens based on a predetermined curriculum or theme. Provide step-by-step instructions, explanations and demonstrations to help youth engage with the project. Offer guidance and assistance as they work on their projects to ensure that all youth are actively participating. 
â¢	Discuss potential STEM careers with students, providing insights into different professions in fields like technology, engineering and design. 
â¢	Share your own experiences and connect what they are learning with real-world applications of STEM. 
â¢	Keep track of youth participation, progress and any challenges faced during the activities. Update and adjust lesson plans as needed. Communicate with other BGC staff to ensure youth are engaged and on track. 
â¢	Reflection & Feedback â after each session, reflect on what went well and what could be improved. Take note of any adjustments that may need to be made for future programming. Provide feedback to youth on their accomplishments and offering constructive tips for improvement.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Throughout this program, STEM professionals could visit the TMC lab to share their career experiences, explain how they use STEM in their jobs, and highlight the skills they rely on in their work. These discussions would help the extern see the broad spectrum of career paths that STEM education opens up. We can also facilitate industry-specific demonstrations so the extern will get the chance to see real-world applications in action. The extern will learn how to develop and teach STEM curriculum that connects to real-world careers. For instance, instead of just teaching kids how to build a basic circuit, the extern can explain how electrical engineers use circuits to power complex systems in electronics, vehicles and renewable energy sources. 

What types of learning will externs get from this work?
	* Extern will learn what STEM employers want in future STEM employees - hard and soft skills;Project will connect what is taught in schools to real world STEM careers;

Network growth:
	* We will organize guest speaker events where professionals from different STEM fields visit the TMC lab and discuss their careers, the skills required in their fields, and how STEM education contributes to their work. Providing opportunities for our extern to network with these professionals to help them build professional relationships and learn from the diverse paths these individuals have taken. The extern will be invited to participate on the field trip/tour of Micron and any other behind-the-scenes tours of companies that the group may take. These tours will allow the extern to see firsthand how STEM careers are executed in different industries.  

Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;

STEM domains that can be learned about in this role:
	* Chemistry
	* Math
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.)
