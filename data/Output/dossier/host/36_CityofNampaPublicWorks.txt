ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
The City of Nampa has the largest public works department in Idaho ensuring the public health and safety of the community by maintaining the streets, airport, fleet, drinking water systems, irrigation system and the wastewater systems. Our team consists of engineers, GIS analysts, operators and a variety of other roles. 

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* One Water Education and Outreach 

Objectives
	* The City of Nampa is excited to launch a recycled water program and an integrated One Water management approach to the cityâs drinking water, pressurized irrigation, wastewater, and stormwater divisions. This launch provides an exceptional opportunity to create education and outreach materials for students and the public focused on recycled water and other pressing water quality and water conservation issues. This project will provide the Extern the opportunity to learn about and experience STEM-related work that supports the City of Nampaâs One Water management approach at the Water Renewal Facility, Karcher Wetlands, Water Utility Engineering department, GIS and the Environmental Resources team. The position will report to the Public Works Communication Manager and help build and/or curate education and outreach materials for the One Water campaign, the Karcher Wetlands, Water Renewal Facility tours, the recycled water permit, and the stormwater permit.  

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The Extern will first gain exposure of a One Water management approach, philosophy and benefits by taking tours, interacting with key staff from the City of Nampaâs water resources team, and reviewing existing education and outreach material. Then working closely with the Public Works Communication team, the Extern will help design and curate educational materials and experiences targeting middle and high school age students. Example deliverables include: 
â¢	Create age-appropriate lesson plans for students (upper elementary, middle and high school) on constructed wetlands that would set up students for a tour of the Karcher Wetlands. 
â¢	Contribute to the content of educational signs at the Karcher Wetlands targeting students and adults.
â¢	Review existing curriculum and create age-appropriate lesson plans and experiences for students (upper elementary, middle and high school) on recycled water that would set up for a tour of the Water Renewal Facility (or follow up on recycled water post-tour). 
â¢	Review and/or develop suggested tour script and terms for grade level appropriateness for late elementary, middle school and also high school students touring the Water Renewal Facility.
â¢	Explore curriculum ideas to highlight STEM related work supporting One Water infrastructure and programs targeting high school students. 
â¢	Working with the communications team and materials from Project WET, curate or develop 2-3 activity guides and supply kits for teachers to use in the classroom focusing on stormwater, water quality and conservation education.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This project will provide the Extern with an overview of STEM careers related to designing and operating water and wastewater infrastructure and programs in a municipal setting. The project will offer opportunities to job shadow, engage and meet with STEM professionals as well as observe STEM related careers in action for real world examples. Depending on the interests of the Extern, examples could include: 
â¢	Job shadowing an operator, lab technician or engineer at the Water Renewal Facility.
â¢	Learn how GIS supports infrastructure management of the distribution and collections systems for One Water systems including stormwater, pressurized irrigation, domestic water and wastewater.
â¢	Visit the construction site for Nampaâs new water tank with the project manager and talk about skills needed to run large-scale infrastructure projects. 

Network growth:
	* The Extern will be placed in a collaborative team environment, be given the opportunity to shadow professionals and meet 1:1 with staff working in STEM careers. Depending on the interests of the Extern potential opportunities to choose from include: 
â¢	Tour wetlands site with project engineer or program director and review plan set. Understand how an advanced constructed wetlands can treat surface water to remove contaminants of emerging concern.  
â¢	Attend Karcher Constructed Wetlands project meeting(s) to learn more about engineering and design related to constructed wetlands, as well as see the day-to-day world of engineering construction.  
â¢	Job shadow either Water Renewal Facility operator or engineer. Depending on interest, learn more about the SCADA system that operates the Water Renewal Facility. 
â¢	Tour the Water Renewal Facility with a licensed operator.
â¢	Attend construction meeting for the Water Renewal Facility headworks project to see the day-to-day world of engineering construction and problem-solving approach.
â¢	Learn how GIS supports infrastructure management of the distribution and collections systems for One Water systems including stormwater, pressurized irrigation, domestic water and wastewater. 
â¢	Visit construction site and attend project meeting with a city civil engineer for a large domestic waterline or irrigation line installation to gain insight into the engineering world.
â¢	Meet with an Engineer in Training to see how water modeling and data software helps the city anticipate fire flows and track data.
â¢	Job shadow an environmental resources technician to learn about water quality monitoring and water conservation efforts. 
â¢	Review how GIS helps the city track the stormwater infrastructure. 
â¢	Visit recycled water outfall with engineer or project manager and communications manager to learn about the construction of, permitting process and education goals for the recycled water outfall.
