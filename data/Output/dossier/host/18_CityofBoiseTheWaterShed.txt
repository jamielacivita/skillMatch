ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Innovation Station and Climate Science Tabling for the WaterShed Education Center

Objectives
	* The extern will assist the WaterShed in developing meaningful activities and learning experiences for the Innovation Station exhibit and our climate science tabling efforts. 		


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The extern will learn about the city of Boise's climate action programs. They will work with members of the Climate Action Division, Public Works, and the WaterShed to build an understanding of how the city is adapting to climate change. They will use their expertise and what they learn to create activities for the Innovation Station exhibit in the WaterShed and create climate science-focused tabling activities for the city. They will also teach environmental education programs and meet city STEM professionals. They will get to attend professional development workshops that the WaterShed is involved in.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* The WaterShed is a part of the Public Works department in the city of Boise. The Public Works department houses experts in climate, water quality, water renewal, geothermal resources, water quality lab analysis, and more. All of these fields should be considered when building the aforementioned activities. The extern will be exposed to many of these professionals and their work. They will have a better understanding of the scope of Public Works and all the careers that make up the department after the summer. 	


Network growth:
	* The WaterShed has a large network of professionals. We work directly with water quality scientists, water renewal experts, sustainability experts, and more. Additionally, we have connections with many organizations that work on conservation and natural resources in the Treasure Valley. The extern will be able to follow their interests and develop connections across the city and beyond. Past externs have been able to shadow employees in STEM careers, such as lab scientists, operators, and water quality teams.
