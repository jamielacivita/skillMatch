ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Museum of Idaho Summer Program Sustainability		

Objectives
	* The extern will work with summer program curriculum already created to make it easily repeatable in future years		


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The extern will review several years of summer curriculum and work with full time staff members to adapt the curriculum so that the lesson plans could be easily handed off to any teacher to facilitate. Additionally, the extern will spend some time in our summer programs planned for this year so that they can understand the tone and intentionality of the curriculum.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This project will show the many different ways MOI has integrated STEM learning into hands-on projects for students. It highlights how community resrouces, like cultural institutions, can be used as real curriculum elements as opposed to just field trips.	


Network growth:
	* The extern will engage with employees in education, curation, and exhibits at MOI to complete this project. Additionally, they'll engage with subject matter experts who played important roles in the initial curriculum development.	


Skills desired:
	* Curriculum Design;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;
