ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
The Micron School of Materials Science and Engineering is an academic department at Boise State Unit. Specific to this externship, the school is the most active research unit at the university - conducting over $10M in external research activity annually. The school contains many research labs, each with a faculty lead who are working in many innovate areas of research including nuclear fuels, semi-conductors, sustainability, and quantum computing. 

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Materials Research Outreach Development

Objectives
	* -Extern learns about several current research areas in materials science and engineering
-The average k-12 student is not aware of the field of materials science and engineering. Sharing the field with teachers is our best way to reach our next cohort of students
-Communicating the research happening on campus to the general public is a constant challenge. At the end of the externship, the school hopes to have a set of new materials (format flexible depending on strengths of intern) to be able to use to help support science communication about the MSMSE research labs to a broad audience. This may take the form of demonstrations, posters, or presentations, etc.
-Having these materials developed frees up school capacity to attend outreach events and invite groups to campus.


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* -Learn about how academic research and study can impact lives.
-Learn about 5 different research areas in Materials Science and Engineering - 2 week rotations about 5 different labs
-Shadow and support faculty, professional researchers, and current students as they work on their research projects
-Participate in laboratory research (tasks could include electron microscope training, sample preparation, running experiments, learning computational skills, etc.)
-During each rotation, learn about the research and help develop materials in collaboration with MSMSE administrative staff to communicate to a broad audience about the work in that lab.
-Participate in the 1 week ASM Teachers Camp held the last week of July

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* -Participate and learn about cutting edge research at an higher education research institution
-Learn about career opportunities in academia and graduate school they can share with students and other teachers
-The extern will be immersed in the community of faculty, staff, and students engaging in academic research
-Exposure to laboratory, experimental, and computational techniques used in materials science and engineering.
-Learn new and groundbreaking applications of fundamental science

Network growth:
	* Mini-rotations (approximately 2 weeks) with 5 different research labs over the course of the summer. Each lab will have different researchers for the individual to learn from.

Partnering with school leadership to help communicate that research to a broader audience


Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!

STEM domain experience desired:
	* Chemistry;Physics;Math;Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.);Engineering
