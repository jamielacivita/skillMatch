ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Micron Technology Operations Educator Externship

Objectives
	* Externs at Micron will gain comprehensive knowledge of semiconductor technology and insight into the critical functions performed by our Manufacturing Technicians and Engineers within the operations team. Micron will benefit as educators share their knowledge of Micron's operations with their students and colleagues. 

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Externs will spend time shadowing a very wide range of team members, departments, managers and senior leaders. Externs will spend time at Micron both inside and outside the cleanroom.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Externs will develop a comprehensive understanding of how STEM is applied in real-world job roles by shadowing various positions within the Operations department. They will gain hands-on experience with equipment and processes critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Externs are required to document their experiences and insights throughout the program. This documentation will facilitate their ability to articulate the value of their learning and share newly acquired knowledge with students and colleagues.

What types of learning will externs get from this work?
	* Extern will get exposed to a specific STEM field;Project will connect what is taught in schools to real world STEM careers;Extern will acquire a new STEM skill;Extern will learn how a STEM organization works;Extern will learn what STEM employers want in future STEM employees - hard and soft skills;

Network growth:
	* Micron has developed a complete schedule for its externs. The schedule includes shadowing in various areas to enhance understanding of the different roles within our operations. This will enable externs to interact with and learn from a diverse group of individuals at Micron.
