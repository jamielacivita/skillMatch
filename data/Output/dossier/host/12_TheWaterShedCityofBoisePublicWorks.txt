ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Innovative Educational Opportunities at The WaterShed

Objectives
	* The extern will assist The WaterShed in developing meaningful activities and learning experiences for the Innovation Station exhibit and our 2025 WaterShed Summer Camp. Objectives would be:
-	Create a unique innovation station curriculum centered on climate action and resiliency.
-	Develop a summer camp curriculum with staff and co-lead the camp.  


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The extern will:
- Collaborate with City Staff in the Public Works Department. 
- Understand the different STEM careers in the Public Works Department. 
- Learn about the city of Boise's climate action programs. 
- Work with members of the Climate Action Division, Public Works, and The WaterShed to build an understanding of how the city is adapting to climate change and translate that into an innovations station design for the new exhibit hall. 
- Help build a summer camp curriculum centered on The WaterShed and the City of Boise Public Works department.
- Support group visits to The WaterShed.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* The WaterShed is a part of the Public Works department in the city of Boise. The Public Works department houses experts in climate, water quality, water renewal, geothermal resources, water quality lab analysis, and more. All these fields should be considered when working towards the objectives of the externship. The extern will be exposed to many of these professionals and their work. They will have a better understanding of the scope of Public Works and all the careers that make up the department. They will also learn strategies that we use to teach about these careers and be able to utilize those in the classroom. 

Network growth:
	* The WaterShed has a large network of professionals. We work directly with water quality scientists, water renewal experts, sustainability experts, and more. Additionally, we have connections with many organizations that work on conservation and natural resources in the Treasure Valley. The extern will be able to follow their interests and develop connections across the city and beyond. We encourage the externs to shadow, tour, and interview experts within the department. Additionally, their work will require collaboration with members of the department. Past externs have relied on these relationships to build effective programming and we expect this yearâs extern to do the same.
