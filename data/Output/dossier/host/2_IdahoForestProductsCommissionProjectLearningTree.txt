Organization: Idaho Forest Products Commission / Project Learning Tree
Contact: Davis-Martinez, Haven 
Email: The Idaho Forest Products Commission (IFPC) sees working forests maintained in Idaho forever through responsible management of public and private forests and through an informed public that understands such management. The work of the Commission will help assure balanced and sustained timber, wildlife, recreation, and scenic beauty for the welfare of the stateâs citizens. Project Learning Tree is the flagship education program of IFPC and aims to advance environmental education, forest literacy, and career pathways using trees and forests as windows on the world. Together, IFPC and PLT deliver education and outreach programs to Idaho educators and students that share how the environment, and our forests in particular, can be used as a classroom to facilitate meaningful STEM experiences and create numerous STEM-connected careers within the forest sector.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* STEM in the Forest: Pathways to Green Careers

Objectives
	* The desired business outcomes of this project include the creation of a comprehensive digital resource that highlights diverse careers within the forest sector, their connection to STEM, and pathways for students to pursue these roles. By working with the Education and Outreach Coordinator, the extern will develop written and video profiles that provide an in-depth look at each career, including personal experiences, educational and training requirements, applications of STEM skills, favorite aspects of the job, and practical advice for young people aspiring to enter the field.

This resource will be shared for free with all Idaho formal and non-formal educators, ensuring broad access and impact. It will also be integrated into the Inland Northwest Forest Products Curriculum, a collaborative effort between the Idaho Forest Products Commission and the University of Idaho, further enhancing its reach and relevance.

By producing this resource, the organization will benefit by increasing awareness of the forest sectorâs critical role in Idahoâs economy and its reliance on STEM skills. Additionally, it will support workforce development by inspiring the next generation of leaders to pursue careers in the forest sector, addressing current and future labor needs.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The extern will play a key role in gathering insights into careers in the forest sector, working closely with the Education and Outreach Coordinator and the creative team for the Idaho Forest Products Commission (IFPC). Their responsibilities will include:
â¢Connecting with Forest Sector Professionals: Reaching out to individuals working in the forest sector to arrange virtual or in-person interviews.
â¢Conducting Interviews: Carrying out 20+ interviews, some of which will be video recorded, each lasting approximately 30 minutes.
â¢Documenting Key Insights: Taking detailed notes during each interview to capture relevant information about the professionalâs career path, STEM skills, and advice for students.
â¢Photography: Taking or collecting photos of the interviewee and their work environment to enhance the profiles.
â¢Writing Profiles: Drafting profiles based on interview content, showcasing the intervieweeâs career journey, how they use STEM, and insights for aspiring professionals.
â¢Collaborating on Design: Working with the IFPC creative team to finalize the layout and format of each profile, ensuring the final product is visually engaging and user-friendly.
â¢Creating Supporting Content: Writing the introduction, supporting resources, and instructional guide that will accompany the profiles, helping educators use the resource effectively in the classroom.

By completing these tasks, the extern will help produce a polished, comprehensive resource that connects STEM education with careers in the forest sector.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* By engaging directly with Idahoans working in the forest sector, the extern will gain firsthand insights into the numerous careers that rely on STEM, such as forest management, environmental science, engineering, and technology-driven resource optimization. Through interviews and field observations, the extern will explore how STEM is applied in real-world problem-solving, sustainability practices, and innovations within one of Idahoâs largest economic sectors.

As part of this project, the extern will contribute to the creation of a free, classroom-ready resource designed to inspire and educate students about these careers. This resource will highlight how STEM intersects with forest management and natural resources, helping students envision themselves as future green leaders in a field critical to Idaho's economic and environmental health.

Additionally, the extern will be equipped to share these learnings with colleagues, broadening the understanding of STEM careers beyond traditional definitions and showcasing the dynamic opportunities available in natural resource sectors. By directly connecting STEM education to real-world careers, this project will empower the extern to bring relevant, impactful knowledge back to the classroom, inspiring the next generation of leaders to drive growth and sustainability in the forest sector.


Network growth:
	* The extern will have multiple opportunities to meet and learn from a diverse group of professionals within the forest sector. By conducting interviews and creating career profiles, the extern will engage directly with individuals who use STEM skills in roles such as forest management, environmental science, ecology, and data analysis. These interactions will provide firsthand insights into how STEM principles are applied in non-traditional STEM fields, broadening their perspective on career possibilities for their students. Additionally, many of the professionals interviewed may be willing to participate in virtual classroom visits, offering students a direct connection to these careers. 

The extern will also participate in the all-expenses-paid Sustainable Forestry Tour for Teachers and Counselors, held June 23â27, 2025, in Moscow, Idaho. This immersive experience will allow them to network with a wide range of professionals from the forest sector, as well as other educators while gaining a deeper understanding of the industry. During the tour, the extern will have further opportunities to conduct interviews, gather project content, and explore how STEM drives innovation and sustainability in one of Idahoâs key economic sectors.

Through these interactions, the extern will develop a rich understanding of STEM careers in the forest sector, enabling them to inspire their students and provide meaningful connections between classroom learning and real-world applications.
