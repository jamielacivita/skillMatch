ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Watershed Monitoring and Assessment

Objectives
	* The extern will help to assess the condition of our sub-watersheds on the forest and the effects of management actions on watershed condition indicators. This helps the forest in it's wildfire crisis strategy monitoring and assessment of the risk reduction work happening across the forest.



Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* •	Collecting soil disturbance data pre- or post-timber sale;
•	Collecting watershed condition indicator survey data at the stream reach level;
•	Collecting survey and morphological stream data in preparation for stream simulations at road-stream crossings;
•	Collecting fish and fish habitat data;

The extern will also help with data in the office by interpreting and compiling the data into reports.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* The extern will be working directly with our experts in hydrology, soils, and engineering. He/she will get real-world experience in how the concepts of the above disciplines are used in natural resource management (Roads, bridges, culverts, wildfires, recreational facilities, fisheries management, and more).

Network growth:
	* See above. He/she will cross several disciplines during his/her externship.

Skills desired:
	* Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Project Management;Email & Administrative Software;Good teamwork/interpersonal skills;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* Earth & Environmental Science;Engineering & Technology;hydrology, soils, engineering;
