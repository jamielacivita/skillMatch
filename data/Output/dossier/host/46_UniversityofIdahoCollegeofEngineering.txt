ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* U of I College of Engineering K12 STEM Outreach Externship

Objectives
	* The extern position will support the Associate Director of Student Engagement and STEM Outreach in building systems and pathways for K12 STEM outreach, including activity creation and refinement, mapping activities to engineering majors and careers, developing space/NASA, semi-conductor, and robotics-related STEM curriculum, building on the ENGR network of K-12 educators, and assisting with a coding camp for middle school students and STEM camp for high school students in Idaho. Travel will be required.

The College of Engineering will benefit greatly from these projects through expansion and updating STEM activities so they are relevant to STEM Outreach, build connections with current educators to learn about current teaching and learning trends in Idaho, and help build more pathways to STEM by engaging externs in learning about engineering and bringing those connections back to their classrooms.

Key responsibilities include planning, coordinating and executing events and STEM activities, gathering information for quality STEM curriculum, conducting informational interviews, and proposing innovative ideas for STEM outreach activity implementation.


Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* In this role, the extern will:
- develop new and modify current STEM curriculum (worksheets, learning outcomes, assessment) related to space/NASA, aerospace, semi-conductors, and robotics in alignment with current college initiatives and partnerships,	
- map the K12 STEM activities to current research and lab activity, and to the engineering and computer science majors offered in the College of Engineering,
- develop an organized system for STEM activity supplies,
- assist the implementation of summer camps including a coding camp for middle school kids in Moscow, Boise, and Twin Falls and possibly programming in partnership with the UI Native American Student Center summer camps (travel required and covered), 
- review and update Idaho K12 educator contact database
- interview College of Engineering faculty and graduate students to learn more about their current research,
- tour industry facilities of industry partners (i.e. Micron, Chobani, Clearwater Paper, SEL) to learn more about real-world STEM careers.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* The extern will meet with engineering faculty and graduate students to learn about the various majors in engineering and computer science, as well as the research and projects being developed. The extern will use this knowledge to develop and modify STEM activities mapped to current research, lab projects, and engineering/computer science majors, as well as Idaho STEM education standards. These activities can be brought back to the classroom, and the extern can develop an action plan to partner with our K12 STEM outreach team to visit their classroom for college ambassadors to teach and engage/inspire their class of students.

Further, through informational interviews with engineering/computer science faculty, and industry tours, the extern will make connections for future field trips and examples of what real-world engineers are working on for a better future.



What types of learning will externs get from this work?
	* Extern will get exposed to a specific STEM field;Project will connect what is taught in schools to real world STEM careers;Extern will acquire a new STEM skill;Extern will learn how a STEM organization works;Extern will learn what STEM employers want in future STEM employees - hard and soft skills

Network growth:
	* Through informational interviews of faculty and graduate students from five engineering and computer science departments, the extern will meet real-world STEM professionals and learn about their jobs and projects. 

Through industry tours, the extern will meet real-world STEM professionals, network, and make connections for prospective K12 activities and field trips. Industry tours may include Micron, Chobani, Clearwater Paper and/or Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. 


Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;Spreadsheet Software (MS Excel or Google Sheets);Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Presentation Software (MS Powerpoint or Google Slides);Project Management;Public Speaking / Group Presentation;Email & Administrative Software

STEM domains that can be learned about in this role:
	* Chemistry
	* Computer Science (e.g., coding, programming languages, software/app development, etc.)

Instructional work required in this role:
	* Secondary-level instructional experience
	* Elementary-level instructional experience
	* Curriculum design	

Types of connections hos is considering during school year:
	* Classroom visits
	* Field trips to our site
	* Participate in STEM nights and Career Days
