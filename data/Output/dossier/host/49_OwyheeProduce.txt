By developing a clear data management workflow and identifying process improvements, the externâs work will help streamline onion intake and storage tracking.

Talent Development and Recruitment:

The extern will design outreach materials and a âDay in the Life of a Scale House Technicianâ curriculum, promoting STEM careers in agriculture.
These efforts will increase student interest in agri-tech roles, positioning Owyhee Produce as a forward-thinking employer and helping build a future talent pool.

Technology Integration:

The externâs work on SharePoint pages and data visualizations will create user-friendly tools for staff, enhancing data accessibility and internal training resources.

Community Engagement and Brand Reputation:

Strengthening relationships with local schools and highlighting career opportunities at Owyhee Produce will reinforce the companyâs reputation as an innovative and community-minded business.
Promoting STEM education in agriculture aligns with broader sustainability and tech-forward initiatives, boosting brand image.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* The STEM externship at Owyhee Produce focuses on scale house operations, data management, and technology integration within an agricultural setting. The extern will gain hands-on experience with real-world data while contributing to process improvements and community outreach efforts.

Daily Tasks:

Data Management & Record-Keeping:

Weigh and log incoming onion shipments, ensuring accuracy in data entry.
Use digital scale programs and storage tracking databases to maintain intake records.
Review and validate records for onion variety, weight, and origin.

Technology Integration:

Learn and troubleshoot scale house software systems.
Shadow IT personnel to understand how digital systems interact with physical processes like scales and storage sensors.
Design and update a SharePoint page to organize scale house data and training resources.

Data Analysis & Visualization:

Create data visualizations to track storage trends and onion flow.
Analyze records to identify patterns or areas for operational improvement.

Process Development:

Draft a âthree-stepâ model for recording, storing, and analyzing data.
Identify and propose automation opportunities to streamline intake and storage tracking.

Outreach & Career Integration:

Develop ideas for high school STEM projects connected to scale house operations.
Create a curriculum outline for a âDay in the Life of a Scale House Technician.â
Draft a marketing plan to promote externship and internship opportunities to local schools.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* This externship at Owyhee Produce will clearly demonstrate how STEM is applied in real-world agricultural careers, giving the extern tangible examples to share with their students.

Technology Integration: The extern will see firsthand how digital scale programs, storage tracking databases, and automation tools streamline the intake and storage of onions. This highlights how software engineering, data management, and IT skills play a vital role in modern farming operations.

Data Science & Analysis: By creating data visualizations and analyzing storage trends, the extern will experience how data science helps optimize workflows and reduce waste â an essential application of math and analytical thinking.

Process Improvement & Automation: The extern will learn how small automation solutions, like streamlining data entry processes or integrating software with physical equipment (scales and sensors), improve efficiency â reinforcing how engineering and technology drive innovation in agriculture.

Career Exploration: Through collaboration with the Operations Manager, IT staff, and Food Safety team, the extern will uncover a variety of STEM-related careers beyond traditional roles, such as agri-tech specialists, data analysts, and automation engineers.

Student Connection: The extern will design a âDay in the Life of a Scale House Technicianâ curriculum, allowing them to translate their experiences into engaging STEM projects for students â bridging classroom learning with real-world applications.

By the end of the program, the extern will have a clear understanding of how STEM supports the agricultural industry and be equipped to inspire students about the diverse, tech-driven career opportunities available in agri-tech. 

Network growth:
	* Owyhee Produce will provide the extern with multiple opportunities to connect with and learn from a diverse range of STEM professionals, helping them gain a well-rounded understanding of how technology and science drive modern agriculture.

Operations Manager & Scale House Team: The extern will work closely with the Operations Manager and scale house staff to understand how data collection, logistics, and technology intersect in daily operations.
