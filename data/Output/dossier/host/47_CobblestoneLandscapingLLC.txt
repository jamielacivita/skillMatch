ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name

Objectives
	* To successfully complete the design and implementation of a noise abatement structure.  We will be monetarily compensated for our services.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Well I suppose that depends on the educator.  What they may take out of the experience that is applicable to their world could vary greatly.  This project is STEM related in virtually every aspect from the design all the way through construction.  I can see applicable teaching opportunities in every phase of the project.  

Network growth:
