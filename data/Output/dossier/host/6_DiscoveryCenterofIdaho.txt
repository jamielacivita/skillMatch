ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
We inspire lifelong interest and learning in science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) and the arts because we believe learning is fun and expands minds and lives.
Because of the opportunities we provide, our community is more scientifically literate, curious and empowered to explore. We prioritize inclusion, diversity, equity and access to strengthen our organization and to help us better understand, connect with and serve our community. Through our work and our partnerships, we are able to engage community members at all levels, meeting them where they are at with the long-term goal of expanding and improving the STEM workforce.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Discovery Center of Idaho Summer Program Support

Objectives
	* Teacher Externs will spend time over the summer partaking in informal educator experiences from multiple angles, supporting summer programs and building capacity for future on- and off-site learning opportunities. Teachers' expertise in engaging learners and creating cohesive lesson plans will assist the Discovery Center's mission to provide unique STEM experiences to curious people of all ages in the Treasure Valley and beyond.		

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Teacher Externs will have a rotating schedule, so they will have the opportunity to fulfill different objectives throughout each week, including acting as a museum docent (interacting with Discovery Center visitors in a meaningful way), supporting summer camps (working alongside our full-time camp instructors to provide fun, out-of-school programming for campers aged 5-14), making exhibit content connections (coming up with ways to relate future exhibit concepts to standards and learning objectives), and creating digital resources (writing scripts for videos intended to generate interest in STEM careers).

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Teacher Externs will have the opportunity to see the daily functionality of an informal educational space, designed to interest people of all ages in STEM concepts and careers.

Network growth:
	* Using a structured schedule which eases the externs into each task, they will be able to work with people engaged in STEM careers at multiple levels, including our education and exhibits teams, as well as seasoned volunteers, ranging from high school to retirees, all of whom have chosen to dedicate time and energy to sharing their passion for STEM with others.

Skills desired:
	* Word Processing Software (MS Word or Google Docs);Presentation Software (MS Powerpoint or Google Slides);Curriculum Design;Email & Administrative Software;any instructional experience is valuable!;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* No, experience in a specific STEM domain isn't necessary;any STEM or educational expertise is valuable!;
