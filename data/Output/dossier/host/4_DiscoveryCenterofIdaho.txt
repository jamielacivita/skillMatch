ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION:
As a hands-on science center located in the heart of downtown Boise, we inspire lifelong interest and learning in science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) and the arts because we believe learning is fun and expands minds and lives. By providing the community with learning opportunities for all ages, including classes, camps, speakers and special events, field trips, and more, we aim to curate a strong STEM identity in everyone who walks through our front doors.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
Name
	* Discovery Center of Idaho Summer Program Support

Objectives
	* Teacher Externs will spend time over the summer partaking in informal educator experiences from multiple angles, supporting summer programs and building capacity for future on- and off-site learning opportunities. Teachers' expertise in engaging learners and creating cohesive lesson plans will assist the Discovery Center's mission to provide unique STEM experiences to curious people of all ages in the Treasure Valley and beyond.

Description and day-to-day tasks:
	* Teacher Externs will have a flexible and rotating schedule, so they will have the opportunity to fulfill different objectives throughout each week, including acting as a museum docent (interacting with Discovery Center visitors in a meaningful way), supporting summer camps (working alongside our full-time camp instructors to provide fun, out-of-school programming for campers aged 5-12), making exhibit content connections (coming up with ways to relate future exhibit concepts to standards and learning objectives), and creating digital resources (writing scripts for videos intended to generate interest in STEM careers). The latter two objectives include the possibility of remote work, making this externship optionally hybrid.

Meaningful learning about STEM careers:
	* Teacher Externs will have the opportunity to see the daily functionality of an informal educational space, designed to interest people of all ages in STEM concepts and careers. This opportunity will also build further relationships between the Discovery Center and local schools in order to share information about resources and opportunities available to educators, students, and families.

Network growth:
	* Using a structured schedule which eases the extern into each task, they will be able to work with people engaged in STEM careers at multiple levels, including our education, marketing, and exhibits teams, as well as seasoned volunteers, ranging from high school to retirees, all of whom have chosen to dedicate time and energy to sharing their passion for STEM with others.

Skills desired:
	* No specific skills needed - we'll take anyone with the right attitude & train on what's needed!;

STEM domain experience desired:
	* Life Science / Biology;Chemistry;Physics;Earth & Environmental Science;Math;Trades & Industry (e.g. manufacturing, automotive, construction, etc.);
