INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* This year, I am determined to enhance my teaching by exploring the many uses of technology. Since transitioning to online teaching, I have realized the immense potential technology holds, but I am unfamiliar with what is available and how to effectively utilize it all. For example, I would like to learn how to use AI, create an app, or design a website.
I think that any newfound knowledge I can gain will enable me to better engage and connect with my students.
This applicant likes work environments that are:
	* Collaborative work
	* Creative work
	* Research or investigative work
