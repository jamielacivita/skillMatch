INTERESTS
Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* As a K-5 STEM Specialist for our building I integrate career readiness skills into all we do, as well as, show the students the variety of STEM opportunities available in Idaho. The Externship program would allow me the opportunity to learn the needs and opportunities of a new field and then be able to share those experiences with my students. The program would deepen my knowledge of the needed skills and contributions of the business entity that I can then in turn reinforce and extend with my students, the students of West Ada and future employee candidates. 
This applicant likes work environments that are:
	* Research or investigative work
	* Task-oriented work
	* Collaborative work
	* Creative work
	* Expect workers to be self-driven

STEM fields they are particularly interested in learning more about:
	* No specific preference - anything goes!
