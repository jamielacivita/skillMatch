Why they want to be a part of this program:
	* I am interested to learn through experience how STEM works in the professional world.  I have always worked in education and I am intrigued to see a variety of other work environments.    Because I teach Art, I wish to learn more about STEM and STEAM and how I might apply it in the classroom.  I have always found the creativity in subjects such as Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.  Often overlooked, it is creativity which helps us see things from a new perspective, problem solve and generate a variety of ideas.
